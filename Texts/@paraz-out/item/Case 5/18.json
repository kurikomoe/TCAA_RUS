    "original": "At 2:00PM, Aster de Wyverngarde went to pay his respects at his father’s coffin. Unbeknownst to him, however, there was a <b>Glyph of Contingency</b> set to trap him inside a <b>Force Cage</b>. The trap triggered and Aster was trapped in that magical cage for its duration.\\n\\nThis caused the Kingsguard to consolidate their forces at Aster’s location. As a result, Lloyd von Sanctus, Coraline Sibyl, and Garrick Pierce were left with far fewer guards defending them.",
