Until the night of the murder, many of her friends and family members hadn’t seen or heard from her.\r\\n\r\\nOn the night of the murder, Beatrice finally returned to her home. She arranged a meeting with her father. This meeting didn’t end as planned. And Beatrice angered William Frega enough for him to declare that he would be disinheriting her that night.\r",
