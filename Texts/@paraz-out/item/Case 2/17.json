    "original": "30 minutes before the Ianus twins found the body, Bellwether walked past Jan in the west wing hallway. He was in her path, so she shoved him out of her way. After that, she knocked over a vase and shattered it. Even though, Jan didn’t say anything to her, she yelled at him to “Be quiet!”. After this interaction, she walked into Lecture Hall 2-B.\r\\n\r\\nThe “Bellwether” witnessed by Jan Hughes must have been disguised with an illusion. In addition to that, whoever he saw that day was <i>physically</i> there.\r",
