    "original": "The Blood Contract seems strange… Unlike Beatrice’s contract, it’s only one page. Even stranger, there’s a large empty space at the top half of the page. There are only a few sentences at the bottom.\r\n\r\n“For the intentions of this contract, the person who hands the contract to Aria Steelwind will be referred to as ‘the Patron’. By signing this contract, Aria Steelwind surrenders her mind, body, and soul to the Patron. This contract will bind Aria Steelwind to the Patron so long as they both live.”\r\n\r\nIt’s signed with Aria’s signature…\r\n\r\nCeleste McCoy saw Aria drop this Contract before she entered the Prayer room with Tyrion. Due to the Empress of Discord changing her memories, she can’t remember what was written on this Contract.  \r\n",
