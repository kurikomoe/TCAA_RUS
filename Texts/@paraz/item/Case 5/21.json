On his way there, he spotted Aria Steelwind throwing something off of the west balcony. \n\nHe wasn’t able to see what she threw. But after Coraline Sibyl’s body was found in Lake Galakrond, he assumed the object must have been Sibyl’s body. However, he could have sworn that he saw something “darker”. But he’s still not sure.\n\nAfter witnessing this, he attempted to enter the Prayer Room but was turned away by the knights guarding it.\n",
