    "original": "After his meeting with Beatrice Frega, William Frega retreated into his Study and locked himself within it. He refused to speak with almost everyone who tried to disturb him. \r\n\r\nThe only person he spoke to was Laefe Frega. She told him about the theft of the Sword of Spell Eating a little after 1:00AM. But William didn’t seem to care and returned to his business.\r\n\r\nThrough Laefe’s thoughts, you know that he entered the study to make some sort of adjustment to his will.\r",
