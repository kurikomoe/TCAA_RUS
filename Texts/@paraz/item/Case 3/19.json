    "original": "A large, unknown metal object fell into the vat around the time that Justin Waye fell into it. The magical liquid reduced it to several small metallic shards. One of the shards has the crest of House von Sanctus: the noble family that controls the city of Aurinax.\r\n\r\nVon Sanctus Industries places its crest on all of its products. Therefore, this shard could have potentially come from a product produced by Von Sanctus Industries.\r",
