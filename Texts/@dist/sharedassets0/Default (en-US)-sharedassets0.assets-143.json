        "Tyrion: ……什么？",
        "Remus: 我一生犯了许多错误……",
        "Remus: 我给了维文加德自保的手段。[p/]但这一切只让他们被卷入可怕的事里。",
        "Remus: 我所创造的东西也让我苦涩……[p/]所以我把自己和自己的人民分隔开来。",
        "Remus: 我本以为最好的做法就是远离尘世，让维文加德保护自己。",
        "Remus: ……现在我明白自己有多愚蠢。",
        "Remus: 我把自己的血肉抛弃在一个不公的世界。",

        "Lucio: 不需要你的直觉。",
        "Lucio: 告诉我们之后怎么了，弗雷加。",
        "MBeatrice: 我们在花园里交谈，[p/]然后我突然感觉不适，失去了意识。",
        "Tyrion: 如果她们和你一起，[p/]妹妹们怎么没注意到？",
        "Lucio: 拉菲和米莉亚姆证言称，[p/]她们的宠物狗在走廊里乱跑。",
        "Lucio: 她们为了追狗，离开了证人和伊尔马特。",
        "Lucio: 等妹妹们再回到花园，[p/]比亚特丽丝和伊尔马特已经不见了。",
        "MBeatrice: ……",

        "MBeatrice: 不……[p/]一点都不记得。",
        "MBeatrice: 我只能想象失去意识期间都被迫做了什么。",

        "MBeatrice: 我很困惑。[p/]但我之后听说了发生的事，[p/]也意识到有人操控了我的身体。",

        "MBeatrice: 是的。[p/]这是你会在祷告室看见我的唯一解释。",

        "Lucio: 奥术[i]做不到[/i]意识操控！",

        "Tyrion: 你和我的委托人确实口径一致。",
        "Tyrion: 但你看起来[i]早就知道[/i]她身上发生了什么。",
        "Tyrion: 可能你只是借此编造不在场证明。",
        "MBeatrice: 也不怪你这么想。",
        "MBeatrice: 卡斯伯特先生。[p/]我知道自己没什么信用。[p/]但我[i]现在说的[/i]都是真的。",

        "Tyrion: ……你怎么会想到这边？",
        "MBeatrice: 这个嘛，[p/]如果有证据证明是[i]别人[/i]进行操控，[p/]我[i]和[/i]阿莉亚都能脱罪。",
        "MBeatrice: 好好想想，卡斯伯特先生。[p/]难道没有",
        "MBeatrice: 这不是最佳结果吗？",
        "MBeatrice: 唉……",
        "Tyrion: ……怎么了？",
        "MBeatrice: 没事。",
        "她看起来被什么惹得不太开心……",
        "Player: Overflow",
        "她的作证方式有点奇怪。",
        "她立马得出了自己被人操控的结论。",
        "还有，为什么要提起阿莉亚的事？",

        "Tyrion: 但我这恰好有[i]一件[/i]证据，虽然关联相对微弱。",
        "MBeatrice: ……这件证据是？",
        "Tyrion: [i]这个[/i]符号……",
        "你把画着紫色标记的羊皮纸拿给她看。",
        "MBeatrice: ……",

        "MBeatrice: ……",
        "MBeatrice: 卡斯伯特先生，我很好奇。[p/]羊皮纸上有什么？",
        "Tyrion: 是这样，比亚特丽丝，[p/]阿莉亚之前在调查维文加德境内的一系列谋杀案。",
        "Tyrion: 这些案子手段残忍，[p/]但是[i]乍一看[/i]互不相关。",

        "Tyrion: 你和我一样是法律工作者。[p/]我们签约前都会仔细浏览内容。",
        "Tyrion: 这也引出了签约人[i]怎么[/i]获得你签名的问题。",

        "Aria: 我只是……",
        "Aria: ……",
        "Tyrion: 该死……[p/]我们都不知道你签约的时候是个什么状况。",
        "Tyrion: 我们知道的只有一件事，[p/]签约人可能用了很多把戏让你中招。",

        "不管他的动力是[i]什么[/i]，[p/]你都会战胜他。[p/]就像战胜别人那样。",
        "Tyrion: 该回去了，塞莱斯特。",
        "Celeste: 好……",
        "不管要做什么，[p/]你都会坚持到最后。",
        "Rath: 现在审理继续。[p/]就从中断的地方开始吧？",
        "Rath: 你接下来要怎么做？",
        "Tyrion: 我们应该回顾一下关于谋杀案[i]已知[/i]的事情。",
        "Lucio: 哼……[p/]我们确实还有很多目击证人。",
        "Tyrion: 没错……[p/]从最开头说起吧。",
        "Tyrion: 一切都始于昨天中午。",
        "Tyrion: 我，阿莉亚，我的护卫塞莱斯特三人都在我位于瑞思霍姆的家里。",
        "Tyrion: 我们在谈关于一封突然被寄来的信的事情。",
        "Tyrion: 寄信人是加里克·皮尔斯。[p/]他希望下午2:00，与我和塞莱斯特在鳞甲领主大教堂见面。",
        "Tyrion: 为了确保准时，[p/]我们下午 1:00 就抵达了大教堂。",
        "Tyrion: 当时我们还不知道，[p/]大教堂已经不对公众开放了。",
        "Tyrion: 但看守大教堂的骑士放我们进去了。",
        "Tyrion: 他们似乎早知道我们会来。",
        "Lucio: ……这[i]不[/i]应该。",
        "Lucio: 出于事态严肃性，[p/]只有个别人被允许进入大教堂。",
        "Tyrion: 可能有人背后牵线让我们进去。",
        "Lucio: ……[i]也可能[/i]是你们俩违法进了大教堂。",
        "Tyrion: 这个嘛，问问国王卫队的骑士不就知道了。",
        "Lucio: 国王卫队的[i]每条[/i]命令我都知晓。",
        "Lucio: [i]没有[/i]哪条说了要放你们通过。",
        "Tyrion: ……我们遇见的骑士可能也是昏迷者之一。",
        "Tyrion: 在他们恢复意识之前，[p/]我们无从得知。",
        "Rath: 我们先继续进行吧……",
        "Lucio: 哼……",
        "Tyrion: 总之，[p/]我们提前抵达教堂，[p/]去见皮尔斯之前的一小时里简单赏景。",
        "Tyrion: 这段时间里，[p/]我们遇见了雷穆斯，[p/]卢西奥，[p/]阿莉亚，[p/]阿斯特，[p/]阿拉里克。",
        "Tyrion: 同一时间，[p/]阿莉亚和阿斯特一起去议长舍与之会面。",
        "Tyrion: 探索大教堂时，[p/]我们还与冯·桑克图斯和希比尔交谈过。",
        "Tyrion: 之后还与弗雷加三姐妹及厄莉斯·伊尔马特交谈。",
        "Lucio: 厄莉斯·伊尔马特？",
        "Tyrion: 她是比亚特丽丝·弗雷加的一个朋友。",
        "Tyrion: 国王卫队不允许她把自己的使魔带进大教堂。",
        "Tyrion: 厄莉斯就充当了她的向导。",
        "Lucio: 嗯……",
        "Tyrion: 总之，[p/]我们下午1:45左右离开花园去祷告室见皮尔斯。",
        "Tyrion: 与此同时，[p/]阿莉亚因感到恶心而离开了与议长的谈话。",
        "Tyrion: 她最后记得的场面是自己看向迦拉克隆湖。",
        "Lucio: 真是个好[i]故事[/i]。",
        "Tyrion: [i]不管怎样[/i]，[p/]下午 2:00，[p/]阿斯特去悼念先王。",
        "Tyrion: 但他并不知道，遗棺那里被法师设下了[b]有备无患[/b]法术。",
        "Tyrion: 目的是为了用[b]坚牢术[/b]困住他。",
        "Rath: 真是卑鄙……",
        "Lucio: 考虑到之后发生的事情，[p/]攻击国王陛下可能是为了声东击西……",
        "Tyrion: 没错……",
        "Tyrion: 这也是比亚特丽丝和厄莉斯失踪的时间。",
        "Tyrion: 考虑到这些事情的发生时间，[p/]比亚特丽丝被操控是在阿斯特被困[i]之后[/i]。",
        "Lucio: ……你要说控制了[i]她[/i]的也是“签约人”？",
        "Tyrion: 不。[p/]我不觉得……",
        "Tyrion: 根据契约内容，[p/]她的意识归属无序女皇，[p/]并不是签约人。",
        "Tyrion: 此外，[p/]也是女皇[i]起草[/i]阿莉亚的血契。",
        "Tyrion: 签约人和女皇显然是同谋关系。",
        "Lucio: ……很好。[p/][i]又多一个[/i]恶魔。",
        "Tyrion: ……先不提这个，[p/]签约人和女皇准备就绪。",
        "Tyrion: 屠杀也在此刻开始。",
        "Tyrion: 签约人控制了阿莉亚的身体。[p/]利用她在下午 2:05 杀害了冯·桑克图斯。",
        "Tyrion: 根据推测，[p/]阿莉亚此时在公共休息室纵火。",
        "Tyrion: 这里也是冯·桑克图斯尸体的发现场所，[p/]意味着这里就是谋杀现场。",
        "Tyrion: 之后不久，[p/]阿拉里克王子看到冒出的烟，问阿莉亚怎么回事。",
        "Tyrion: 阿莉亚用未知的[b]形变[/b]法术使其无法行动。",
        "Lucio: 这个签约人竟敢利用她攻击王子……",
        "Tyrion: 幸运的是，[p/]法术效果只是暂时的，[p/]阿拉里克没有受伤。",
        "Tyrion: 这之后，[p/]下午 2:15，签约人控制阿莉亚杀害希比尔。",
        "Tyrion: 希比尔的尸体被带到西侧阳台，[p/]阿莉亚在这里将尸体投入迦拉克隆湖中。",
        "Tyrion: 议长阿契厄斯目击了这一行为。[p/]但他后来才意识到被从阳台丢下的是什么。",
        "Tyrion: 议长虽然觉得奇怪。[p/]但他还是继续去忙自己的事了。",
        "Tyrion: 他的目的地是祷告室。[p/]但被那里的守卫拒之门外。",
        "Tyrion: 与此同时，[p/]塞莱斯特和我……[p/]正与皮尔斯勋爵[i]交谈[/i]。",
        "Tyrion: 我们提早出现在了约定地点，[p/]但当时他等的明显是别人。",
        "Tyrion: 我们试图探究怎么回事。[p/]但他拒绝回答问题。",
        "Tyrion: 下午 2:20 左右，我们听到外面有骚乱。",
        "Tyrion: 塞莱斯特出去调查了。",
        "Tyrion: ……也就是在这时和阿莉亚博斗起来。",
        "Tyrion: 签约人的目标是加里克·皮尔斯，[p/]但塞莱斯特强得他束手无策。",
        "Tyrion: 双方斗了大约15分钟，阿莉亚才终于成功推开她。",
        "Lucio: ……",
        "Tyrion: 二人搏斗期间，[p/]女皇派比亚特丽丝进入祷告室。",
        "Tyrion: 可能也用了隐形法术避人耳目。",
        "Tyrion: 之后女皇利用她施展[b]睡眠术[/b]，让我和皮尔斯失去意识。",
        "Tyrion: 当时我记得自己特意看了一下时间。",
        "Tyrion: 一定是下午 2:30 没错。",
        "Lucio: ……假设你的证言属实，[p/]比亚特丽丝·弗雷加也是计划里的重要一环。",
        "Tyrion: 对……[p/]考虑到屠杀的迅速程度，[p/]女皇和签约人一定在合作。",
        "Tyrion: 两人应该提前商议好了，怎么利用比亚特丽丝和阿莉亚实施谋杀。",
        "Tyrion: 总之[p/]，比亚特丽丝让我们沉睡之后，[p/]阿莉亚才终于推开塞莱斯特进入祷告室。",
        "Tyrion: 在塞莱斯特追上她之前，[p/]阿莉亚就已经杀掉皮尔斯。",
        "Tyrion: 塞莱斯特进入房间时，阿莉雅和我已经失去意识。",
        "Tyrion: 签约人杀害了三名贵族，实现了目标。",
        "Tyrion: 他们也不再需要操控阿莉亚，这可能是她失去意识的原因。",
        "Tyrion: 阿莉亚和我很快恢复了意识。",
        "Tyrion: 此时裁判所以谋杀罪名逮捕了她。",
        "Lucio: 唔……[p/]皮尔斯勋爵是受害者之一。",
        "Lucio: 你们的会面比我预想的要重要。",
        "Lucio: 所以卡斯伯特，告诉我。[p/][s/]你们谈论的内容是？",
        "Tyrion: ……",
        "Celeste: ……没关系。[p/]可以告诉他们。",
        "Tyrion: 好吧……[p/]只要你不介意。",
        "Tyrion: ……过去数个月，[p/]塞莱斯特和我都在调查谁是她的亲生父母。",
        "Lucio: 哼……[p/]我记得有不少人抱怨她在勋爵舞会期间的行为。",
        "Tyrion: 理论上，[p/]加里克·皮尔斯握有我们寻找的答案。",
        "Tyrion: 寄给我们的信里说，他想“用这一信息交换自己的自由”。",
        "Tyrion: 我[i]以为[/i]这是他让我当自己的律师。",
        "Lucio: 你觉得我们会信？！",
        "Lucio: 为什么他要找给自己定罪的律师辩护？！",
        "Tyrion: [i]我们[/i]也这么想过。",
        "Tyrion: 到达会面地点时，[p/]皮尔斯找的人明显不是[i]我[/i]。",
        "Tyrion: 收到这封信的本应另有其人。",
        "Rath: ……",
        "Lucio: ……最好别让我发现你在说谎，卡斯伯特。",
        "Tyrion: 不绕弯子，[p/]我不在乎你信不信。",
        "Tyrion: 不提这个，[p/]仔细回顾阿莉亚的行为，[p/]我们可以完善签约人的心理档案。",
        "Lucio: ……这一点确实。",
        "Tyrion: 首先，[p/]辩方希望传唤裁判所指挥官作证。",
        "Tyrion: 他的证言或许能解释冯·桑克图斯与希比尔的死亡之谜。",
        "Tyrion: 尽管目击证词众多，[p/]我们明确知道的也只有[i]皮尔斯[/i]的死法。",
        "Lucio: 对……[p/]他被用自己的血冻成的魔法剑刃刺穿心脏。",
        "这么说有点残酷，[p/]但他和弗林哈特死法一致也是受报应。",
        "虽然这么说也不会让塞莱斯特更好受。",
        "Tyrion: 不管怎样，[p/]我们需要找出杀害这两人的[i]具体[/i]手段。",
        "Tyrion: 屠杀高效迅速。",
        "Tyrion: 事前规划与临场合作必不可少。",
        "Tyrion: 如果能知道谁可能拥有足够情报，[p/]或许就能揪出幕后黑手。",
        "Rath: 我明白了……[p/]听起来是个很好的计划。",
        "Lucio: 国王卫队！[p/][s/]护送指挥官奥蒙·怀特上证人席！",
        "Lucio: 证人。[p/]请向法庭陈述你的姓名与职业。",
        "Orym: 呃、[p/][s/]好……[p/][s/]我……[p/][s/]唔……",
        "Orym: ……",
        "Tyrion: 指挥官？",
        "Orym: 对不起！[p/][s/]我做不到啊！",
        "Orym: 我怎么能若无其事？！",
        "Orym: 我[i]正后方[/i]可站着一只大蜥蜴！",
        "Rath: ……说我是蜥蜴可[i]非常[/i]粗鲁，指挥官。",
        "Orym: 对、[p/][s/]对不起，鳞甲领主……[p/]殿下……",
        "Tyrion: 指挥官……[p/]努力证言发生了什么就好。",
        "Orym: 好、[p/][s/]好的……",
        "Orym: 一切都要从我们收到国王卫队报告时说起。[p/]检察官攻击了阿拉里克王子，公共休息室还着火了。",
        "Orym: 我们不确定斯蒂尔文德那边怎么回事。[p/]就先去公共休息室帮忙灭火。",
        "Orym: 但我们抵达时，[p/]发现一群卫兵昏倒在祷告室前。",
        "Orym: 我们就先去了祷告室。[p/]也在那里发现了皮尔斯的尸体，以及旁边失去意识的斯蒂尔文德和卡斯伯特。",
        "Orym: 之后我们也发现了冯·桑克图斯和希比尔的尸体。[p/]这时我们才意识到三个人都是被她杀害的。",
        "Tyrion: 所以你们还是不知道被操控的斯蒂尔文德怎么杀掉冯·桑克图斯与希比尔的？",
        "Orym: 毫无头绪。",
        "Orym: 冯·桑克图斯的情况更糟。[p/]火几乎烧掉了所有尸体上的线索。",
        "Tyrion: 那希比尔呢？[p/]她身上有没有留下线索？",
        "Orym: 我也不清楚。[p/]她没有遭受外伤。",
        "Orym: 我们只知道她是窒息身亡。",
        "嗯……[p/]调查中肯定还有其他信息。",
        "Orym: 一切都要从我们收到国王卫队报告时说起。[p/]检察官攻击了阿拉里克王子，公共休息室还着火了。",
        "Tyrion: 报告主要基于阿拉里克王子的证言。[p/]没错吧？",
        "Orym: 没错。[p/]我们还是不知道她用的是什么[b]形变[/b]法术。",
        "Tyrion: 根据报告时间来看，[p/]肯定是在三起谋杀过去一段时间以后。",
        "Orym: 对。[p/]这样的结果令人遗憾。",
        "Orym: 如果斯蒂尔文德真的[i]被操控[/i]了，[p/]也是被效率很高的人操控。",
        "问题就是为什么幕后黑手这么高效。",
        "Orym: 我们不确定斯蒂尔文德那边怎么回事。[p/]就先去公共休息室帮忙灭火。",
        "Tyrion: 这么做明智吗？",
        "Tyrion: 不管犯人是谁，[p/]被攻击的可是维文加德王子。",
        "Orym: 被[b]坚牢术[/b]困住的国王已经够让人忙活了。",
        "Orym: 那一小时里发生了[i]太多[/i]。",
        "Orym: 我们的注意力都放在保护皇室安全上。",
        "Lucio: 现在已经能确定攻击国王是为了转移注意。",
        "Lucio: 策划这些的人知道，我们会集中力量保证皇室安全。",

        "Tyrion: 你有看见阿莉亚或者塞莱斯特吗？",
        "Orym: 没有……[p/]只看见了她们搏斗后的一片狼藉。",
        "Orym: 走廊里到处都是印痕和凹坑。",
        "Lucio: 皮尔斯的死亡时间是下午2:45。",
        "Lucio: 骑士们直到下午3:10才抵达公共休息室。",
        "Lucio: 搏斗发生过去一阵后他们才到达祷告室。",
        "Tyrion: 等等……[p/]你和皮尔斯的尸体在一起待了25分钟？",
        "Tyrion: 为什么不找人帮忙？",
        "Celeste: 因、[p/][s/]因为你醒不过来。[p/]所以我一直在给你传输治愈魔力。",
        "Celeste: 现在想想，[p/]我确实应该找人帮忙。",

        "Tyrion: 呃、[p/][s/]是啊……[p/]抱歉……",
        "回忆当时的事让她很难受。",
        "最好小心一点。",

        "Orym: 对。[p/]我们当时一头雾水。",
        "Orym: 皮尔斯已经死了。[p/]你和斯蒂尔文德也没有意识。",
        "Tyrion: 我知道[i]自己[/i]为什么没有意识。[p/]我当时被用了专门催眠别人的法术。",
        "Tyrion: 但阿莉亚怎么也失去了意识？",
        "Orym: 我们也不懂。[p/]恶魔操控的事情我们都是今天才[i]听说[/i]。",
        "Orym: 就我们掌握的情报而言，[p/]那可能是被操控意识一小时以上的后遗症。",
        "这么说有道理。[p/]但这个方向的逻辑真的只是巧合吗？",
        "Orym: 之后我们也发现了冯·桑克图斯和希比尔的尸体。[p/]这时我们才意识到三个人都是被她杀害的。",
        "嗯……[p/]最后一句证词有点含糊。",
        "也许应该让他针对其中一件谋杀案展开说明。",
        "Orym: 斯蒂尔文德肯定是在公共休息室攻击了冯·桑克图斯，使其窒息。",

        "Orym: 攻击肯定使他痛苦异常。",

        "Orym: 斯蒂尔文德肯定是在阳台附近攻击了希比尔。[p/]根据尸检报告，[p/]她用某种手段令其窒息。",
        "Tyrion: 因为有人在尸体上用了[b]疗愈术[/b]，[p/]窒息手段不得而知。",
        "Orym: 对……[p/]想搞清楚很麻烦。",

        "Tyrion: 你们怎么知道尸体在那里？",
        "Orym: 屠杀开始后，[p/]我们发现哪儿都找不到她。",
        "Orym: 国王卫队成员之一使用了[b]定位生物[/b]，发现她的位置在湖里。",

        "Tyrion: 这些谋杀案里，[p/]皮尔斯的案子情报最多。",
        "Orym: 对。[p/]目前来看，[p/]签约人也没打算放过麦考伊。",
        "Orym: 那场持久战想必打了他们一个措手不及。",

        "Tyrion: ……为什么？",
        "Lucio: 我的女儿可当不了士兵。[p/]她一点战斗天赋都没有。",
        "Lucio: 而且我[i]本人[/i]体验过麦考伊的战斗能力。",
        "Lucio: 虽然不愿意承认，[p/]但公平战斗的话，麦考伊应该能轻松碾压我的女儿。",
        "Celeste: 她、[p/]她的魔法很难缠。",
        "Celeste: 我也完全不知道她能用什么法术。[p/]所以必须小心应战。",
        "Celeste: ……虽然发生了这么多，[p/]但我当时[i]真的[/i]不想伤害她。",
        "Lucio: 唔……[p/]太过善良会害死你的，麦考伊。",

        "Theon: 当然不对！[p/][s/]我的血怎么够呢！",
        "Lucio: 你让我说完——？！",
        "Theon: 主啊，我任您处置！",
        "Theon: 要花点时间就是了。",
        "Theon: 召集追求者也需要时间——",
        "Rath: 老天爷啊！[p/][s/]我们只想要你的证言！",
        "Rath: ……只需要你告诉我们，昨天在西侧阳台看见斯蒂尔文德女士干了什么。",
        "Theon: ……噢、[p/][s/]噢，我明白了。",
        "Theon: 主啊，如果这真的是您的愿望。",
        "Tyrion: ……我们就[i]不管[/i]他刚才的大屠杀宣言了？",
        "Lucio: 住嘴！[p/][s/]不要再挑动他了！",
        "Theon: 我在住所进行文书工作，忙到忘了时间。[p/]听到闹钟才想起来，该进行下午的祷告了。",
        "Theon: 我向着祷告室出发，发现斯蒂尔文德女士正在西侧阳台往下看。",
        "Theon: 我向她打招呼，但被无视了。[p/]这时我发现，她正从阳台把什么大东西推入迦拉克隆湖。",
        "Theon: 我问她在干什么。[p/]但她还是无视了我，[p/]转身向祷告室走去。",
        "Theon: 我没多想，也向祷告室走过去。[p/]看守的卫兵把我拦下了。",
        "Theon: 我就折返回自己的房间祈祷。",
        "Tyrion: 从时间上看，[p/]这些事就发生在她开始攻击祷告室几分钟前。",
        "Theon: 是的……[p/]我很幸运。[p/]仁慈的鳞甲领主保佑了我。",
        "Rath: 拜托。[p/] 不要……[p/] 说了。",
        "考虑到她的移动迅速程度，[p/]等这几分钟一定有其理由。",
        "她在等议长离开吗？",
        "也许应该更仔细检查一下每件事发生的时间点。",
        "Theon: 我在住所进行文书工作，忙到忘了时间。[p/]听到闹钟才想起来，该进行下午的祷告了。",
        "Tyrion: 闹钟？",
        "Theon: 是一个很简单的奥术能源装置。[p/]我借此提醒自己每日祷告。",
        "Tyrion: ……明白了。[p/]需要你本人设置闹钟时间吗？",
        "Theon: 需要。[p/]我设定的时间是下午 2:10：祷告五分钟前。",
        "Theon: 下午 2:10 闹钟响的时候，我在房间里。[p/]听见铃声才意识到该进行下午的祷告了。",
        "Tyrion: 所以你下午一般在 2:15 祷告？",
        "Theon: 是的。[p/]这也是巨龙之神巴哈姆特的神圣时刻。",
        "Rath: ……[i]我[/i]倒是头一次听说。",
        "Theon: 我犯错了？！",
        "Theon: 主啊，请原谅我！[p/]我竟然亵渎了神灵！",
        "Rath: 呜呃……[p/]算了算了。",
        "Rath: 忘掉刚才的话吧……",
        "Theon: 我向着祷告室出发，发现斯蒂尔文德女士正在西侧阳台往下看。",
        "Tyrion: 她是什么表情？",
        "Theon: 冰冷且没有感情。",
        "Lucio: ……当时她肯定还在被签约人操控。",
        "Theon: 确实。[p/]这样解释最合理。",
        "Tyrion: 确实……[p/]",
        "Tyrion: 具体时间是？",
        "Theon: 我的闹钟响完不久。[p/]肯定是在下午 2:15 之前。",
        "Theon: 我向着祷告室出发，发现斯蒂尔文德女士正在西侧阳台往下看。[p/]时间是下午 2:15 之前。",
        "Tyrion: 所以她在看迦拉克隆湖？",
        "Theon: 现在想来，[p/]她可能在检查能不能从这里把希比尔小姐的尸体丢[i]入[/i]湖里。",
        "Tyrion: 但她好像不介意[i]你[/i]在旁边看着啊。",
        "Tyrion: 说到底，为什么她要大费周章藏尸呢？",
        "Lucio: 签约人明显是为了推迟谋杀案被发现的时间。",
        "Lucio: 毕竟被告很晚才成功杀害了皮尔斯。",
        "的确说得通。[p/]但他们应该没有[i]预料[/i]到要和塞莱斯特打那么久。",
        "她把希比尔的尸体丢入湖里[i]一定[/i]是有理由的。",
        "Theon: 我向她打招呼，但被无视了。[p/]这时我发现，她正从阳台把什么大东西推入迦拉克隆湖。",
        "Tyrion: 你被无视了？她是什么表情？",
        "Theon: 冰冷且没有感情。",
        "Lucio: ……当时她肯定还在被签约人操控。",
        "Theon: 确实。[p/]这样解释最合理。",
        "Tyrion: 你什么时间遇见她的？",
        "Theon: 我的闹钟响完不久。[p/]肯定是在下午 2:15 之前。",
        "Theon: 当时还没到下午 2:15。[p/]我们只短暂相遇。[p/]这时我发现，她正从阳台把什么大东西推入迦拉克隆湖。",
        "Tyrion: ……一定是希比尔的尸体。",
        "Theon: ……应该是的。",
        "Tyrion: ……听起来没什么自信啊。",
        "Theon: 我印象里希比尔小姐的衣袍颜色更为鲜艳。",
        "Theon: 可是，[p/]斯蒂尔文德女士扔进湖里的东西颜色暗沉。",
        "Tyrion: 对了……[p/]你之前也提到过。",
        "Lucio: 肯定只是阳光的影响。",
        "Lucio: 阳台就在希比尔小姐尸体的发现位置正上方。",
        "Lucio: [i]很明显[/i]，你看到的是被告在丢弃尸体。",
        "Lucio: 不然还能是什么？",
        "Theon: 嗯……[p/]你说的大概没错。",
        "Theon: 我问她在干什么。[p/]但她还是无视了我，[p/]转身向祷告室走去。",
        "Tyrion: 签约人可能在操控她赶时间。",
        "Tyrion: 但您没被攻击还是让我很惊讶。",
        "Tyrion: 就算假设签约人要栽赃，[p/]当时她也还没杀掉皮尔斯。",
        "Theon: 是的。[p/]这一点我也不明白。",
        "Theon: 可能我该庆幸自己毫发无损。",
        "Tyrion: 总之，[p/]你们相遇多久？",
        "Theon: 因为她根本没理我，所以时间不长。",
        "Theon: 感觉不超过两分钟。",
        "Theon: 我花了大约两分钟尝试和她交谈。[p/]但她还是无视了我，[p/]转身向祷告室走去。",
        "Tyrion: 看来你们只是擦肩而过啊。",
        "Lucio: 签约人当时正在控制她。",
        "Lucio: 肯定是觉得无视的话议长就会更快离开。",
        "但是就地把他杀了不也很容易？",
        "杀了议长然后把他也扔进湖里应该不难。[p/]就像对希比尔做的那样。",
        "Theon: 我没多想，也向祷告室走过去。[p/]看守的卫兵把我拦下了。",
        "Tyrion: 是说……[p/]这些看守还在昏迷中。",
        "[i]依然[/i]找不到合理解释让你很不自在。",
        "无序女皇用了什么恶魔才会的魔法吗？",

        "但现在也只能暂时记在心里。",
        "Tyrion: 总之，[p/]这是什么时候发生的？",
        "Theon: 应该是下午 2:15。[p/]我通常也是这个时间抵达祷告室。",
        "Theon: 我没多想，也向祷告室走过去。[p/]下午 2:15 到达时，看守的卫兵把我拦下了。",

        "Tyrion: 屠杀期间你一直呆在房间里？",
        "Theon: 是的。[p/]之前也提到过，[p/]我的房间利用魔法做了隔音。",
        "Theon: 房间看守和我都完全没意识到在发生什么。",
        "Theon: 直到国王卫队成员来通知我，我们才知道国王身上发生了什么。",
        "国王卫队的成员和他自己的“看守”当时都在场。",
        "那些人应该也能证实议长没有撒谎。[p/]虽然他这逃过一劫还是太巧合了。",
        "Tyrion: 总之，[p/]你在房间里待了多久。",
        "Theon: 一直待到国王卫队说已经安全了。",
        "Theon: 我想应该是直到下午 3:15。",
        "就是阿莉亚被捕的时间。",
        "Theon: 我就折返回自己的房间祈祷。[p/]在那里一直等到下午 3:15。",
        "Tyrion: 所以屠杀结束前你都在自己的房间里。",
        "Tyrion: 这期间你的看守有看到斯蒂尔文德吗？",
        "Theon: 他们没有。",
        "Theon: 我们只知道国王陛下被困住了。",
        "Theon: 我们并不知道斯蒂尔文德女士当时在攻击别人。",
        "Lucio: 议长明显不是签约人的目标之一。",
        "Lucio: 签约人完全没有想让我的女儿和议长对上。",

        "Tyrion: 但也留下了一个问题……",
        "Lucio: ……",
        "Lucio: ……不要欲言又止了。[p/]我不[i]蠢[/i]，卡斯伯特。",
        "Tyrion: 其实，[p/]我并不觉得是你。",
        "Lucio: ……来这套？",
        "Tyrion: 在场所有人里，[p/]你确实能轻易骗自己的女儿签约血契。",
        "Tyrion: 但你[i]有什么[/i]必要这么做？",
        "Tyrion: 你是维文加德的大将军，[p/]教堂里[i]遍布[/i]你的手下。",
        "Tyrion: 你完全可以用下属法师来杀人。",
        "Tyrion: 也不[i]需要[/i]和恶魔签什么契约。",
        "Rath: 那卢西奥为什么[i]没有[/i]被刺杀？",
        "Tyrion: 根据与塞莱斯特的搏斗来看，[p/]阿莉亚的战斗能力有限。",
        "Tyrion: 签约人可能只是觉得阿莉亚打不过大将军。",
        "Tyrion: 但还有另一种解释。",
        "Player: 签约人 想要栽赃 斯蒂尔文德一家 谋杀罪名",
        "Player: Fail",
        "不对……[p/]签约人没有攻击过卢西奥·斯蒂尔文德。",
        "控制阿莉亚的时候，[p/]签约人也没有想着隐藏她的行踪。",
        "他们[i]想让[/i]别人看见她。",
        "Tyrion:签约人[i]想让[/i]别人怀疑斯蒂尔文德家犯案。",
        "Tyrion: 因此利用卢西奥·斯蒂尔文德的女儿杀人。",
        "Tyrion: 所以他们刻意留了活口，让人们怀疑斯蒂尔文德勋爵。",
        "Lucio: 他们利用我女儿就是[i]这个[/i]原因？",
        "……你感到的是一丝愤怒吗？",
        "Tyrion: ……总之，[p/][i]这个[/i]原因和我之后要说的有关。",
        "Tyrion: 假设我们从未发现阿莉亚与无序女皇签订的血契。",
        "Tyrion: 会发生什么？",
        "Rath: ……我们会认为斯蒂尔文德女士感染了法师之疫。",
        "Rath: 她会被判谋杀罪成立，[p/]斯蒂尔文德家也会立刻失势。",
        "Tyrion: 一个月前左右，[p/]弗雷加一族的领主去世。",
        "Tyrion: 继任者：[p/]拉菲·弗雷加[p/]仓促上阵，毫无准备。",
        "Tyrion: [i]现在[/i]，冯·桑克图斯和希比尔家的领主也都死了。",
        "Tyrion: ……而斯蒂尔文德家的人要承担这一切罪名。",
        "Rath: 四大支柱家族都会因屠杀被削弱……",
        "Tyrion: 我认为还有一层意义。",
        "Tyrion: 假设签约人的目的是削弱四大支柱家族，一切都说得通了。",
        "Tyrion: ……加里克·皮尔斯谋杀案[i]除外[/i]。",
        "Lucio: 是的……[p/]与希比尔和冯·桑克图斯不同，[p/]皮尔斯没什么政治影响力。",
        "Tyrion: 更重要的是，[p/]皮尔斯下个月就要因谋杀弗林哈特·麦考伊被执行死刑。",
        "Tyrion: 为什么签约人要杀一个将死之人？",
        "Player: 皮尔斯 知道了 塞莱斯特父母 身份",
        "Player: Fail",
        "不对……[p/]不管签约人做什么，皮尔斯都[i]会[/i]死。",
        "皮尔斯最近肯定做过什么事。",
        "直接导致签约人必须尽快杀害他。",
        "Tyrion: 签约人需要皮尔斯尽快死亡，所以才杀害了他。",
        "Tyrion: 皮尔斯[i]知道[/i]塞莱斯特亲生父母的身份。",
        "Celeste: ……我的父母？",
        "Tyrion: 你记得皮尔斯会面当天说了什么吧？",
        "Garrick: 啊……[p/]你终于到了……",
        "Garrick: 看来你已经下了决心——",
        "Garrick: 等等……[p/][s/]你们两个？",
        "Celeste: 我们收到了你的信。",
        "Garrick: 信？[p/][s/]什么信？！",
        "Tyrion: 你……[p/]寄的信。皮尔斯。",
        "Tyrion: 信里说你知道塞莱斯特的父母是谁。",
        "Garrick: 我[i]确实[/i]寄了信，[p/]但不是给[i]你们[/i]。",
        "Tyrion: 信该寄给的人不是我们。",
        "Celeste: ……对了！",
        "Tyrion: 也就有一个问题。",
        "Player: 签约人",
        "Player: Fail",
        "不对……[p/]皮尔斯应该是把信寄给了和案件密切相关的人。",
        "只有一个可能性。",
        "Tyrion: 只有一个可能收到信的人。",
        "Tyrion: 就是策划屠杀的签约人！",
        "Lucio: 你是说——！",
        "Tyrion: 塞莱斯特父母的身份会对签约人不利！",
        "Rath: 肃静！注意法庭秩序！",
        "Celeste: 但是……[p/]我不懂。",
        "Tyrion: 抱歉。[p/]我知道这很难接受。",
        "Tyrion: 但签约人肯定是在针对你。",
        "Tyrion: 皮尔斯知道塞莱斯特亲生父母的身份，尝试借此威胁签约人。",
        "Tyrion: 但签约人没有遵从皮尔斯的要求，[p/]转手把信寄给了我。",
        "Lucio: 为什么要费力气诱使[i]你[/i]过去？！",
        "Lucio: 签约人大可以让皮尔斯在祷告室内等候，同时控制被告实施杀人。",
        "Tyrion: 回想一下，[p/]签约人很可能也想杀掉塞莱斯特。",
        "Celeste: ……什么？",
        "Tyrion: 签约人知道我不会单独和皮尔斯见面。[p/]也知道关于[i]塞莱斯特[/i]的信息。",
        "Tyrion: 签约人应该猜到我会和她一同前往。",
        "Tyrion: 同时杀掉皮尔斯和塞莱斯特能清除任何后者可能带来的风险，[p/]一举两得。",
        "Celeste: ……",
        "Rath: ……谁会被这种事情威胁到？",
        "Lucio: 麦考伊的[i]存在[/i]就会威胁到他们……",
        "Lucio: 肯定和她的[i]继承权[/i]有关系。",
        "Tyrion: 没错……",
        "Tyrion: 也就意味着是？",
        "皇室",
        "Tyrion: ……维文加德国王最近去世了。",
        "Tyrion: 如果塞莱斯特是皇室成员呢？",
        "Celeste: ……你觉得我是公主？！",
        "Tyrion: 我不想怀疑阿斯特。[p/]但我们[i]必须[/i]考虑所有可能性。",
        "Tyrion: 如果涉及到继承权，[p/]最有可能的就是皇权。",
        "Tyrion: 不仅如此，[p/]国王也有权赦免皮尔斯的罪。",
        "Lucio: 但这不完全说得通。",
        "Tyrion: 什么意思？",
        "Lucio: 如果麦考伊被丢弃在科尔哈文的小酒馆里，[p/]会被视为私生子。",
        "Celeste: 好吧……[p/]嘴上不饶人。",
        "Lucio: ……[i]重点[/i]是奥利维尔王不会为了皇权丢弃婴儿。",
        "Lucio: 王国需要皇权继承人来延续血脉。",
        "Lucio: 他会利用这个女儿进行政治联姻。",
        "Tyrion: ……令人作呕。",
        "Lucio: 外交手段，卡斯伯特。",
        "Lucio: 总之，[p/]即使麦考伊确实有皇家血统，[p/]阿斯特也是长子。",
        "Lucio: 而且还是纯血长子。",
        "Lucio: 麦考伊甚至都摸不着王座的边。",
        "Tyrion: 这样……[p/]我懂你的意思。",
        "Tyrion: 看来要先排除阿斯特了。",
        "弗雷加一族",
        "Tyrion: 我记得比亚特丽丝·弗雷加受审时，[p/]威廉的遗嘱也被公布了。",
        "Tyrion: 其中提到弗雷加一族的家产会平均分给他的[i]所有[/i]孩子。",
        "Lucio: 喔……[p/]如果麦考伊其实是弗雷加的人，[p/]他的女儿们就必须和她平分财产。",
        "Celeste: ……我真是弗雷加的人？",
        "Tyrion: 我不想怀疑拉菲或者米莉亚姆。[p/]但我们[i]必须[/i]考虑所有可能性。",
        "Tyrion: 我们也知道，[p/]弗雷加一族有和恶魔签约的前科。",
        "Tyrion: 但是，[p/]还是说不通。[p/]我不觉得拉菲或者米莉亚姆能做出这种事。",
        "Rath: ……你的论据是？",
        "Tyrion: 我很擅长判断人品。[p/]她们俩做不出这种事。",
        "Lucio: 呸！[p/]你真让人失望。",
        "Lucio: 威廉的[i]每个[/i]孩子都干得出这种事。",
        "Tyrion: ……那我们等着看吧。",
        "斯蒂尔文德一家",
        "Tyrion: ……虽然难以置信，[p/]但斯蒂尔文德是支柱家族里唯一没有失去领主的。",
        "Lucio: ……你觉得[i]我[/i]是麦考伊的生父？",
        "Celeste: 呜哇……[p/]你对自己[i]已知[/i]的亲生女儿都不怎么样。",
        "Tyrion: 我只是在陈述一种可能性。",
        "Tyrion: 之前也说过，[p/]明知[i]斯蒂尔文德家[/i]会被怀疑的你不可能去陷害自己的女儿。",
        "Tyrion: 但我们要考虑所有可能性。",
        "夺眼者",
        "Tyrion: ……如果是夺眼者策划了这些呢？",
        "Lucio: 夺眼者？[p/]那个黑道？",
        "Lucio: [i]他[/i]策划这些干什么？",
        "Tyrion: 我亲耳听他说计划扩大自己在维文加德的影响力。",
        "Tyrion: 他也和比亚特丽丝同谋试图利用弗雷加一族。",
        "Tyrion: 由于我破坏了他的计划，[p/]他只能采用屠杀这个替补。",
        "Tyrion: 也许我们的看法都是错的。",
        "Tyrion: 或许塞莱斯特其实是皇室成员，他们计划利用她夺取王座？",
        "Lucio: 如果他想这么做，[p/]为什么还要让我的女儿攻击麦考伊？",
        "Lucio: 不仅如此。[p/]他还有机会谋杀国王。",
        "Lucio: 只需要在[b]有备无患[/b]里设下更为致命的法术。",
        "Lucio: 国王陛下可能就和冯·桑克图斯，希比尔，皮尔斯一起归西了。",
        "Tyrion: 确实……[p/]你说得没错。",
        "Tyrion: 但我们要考虑所有可能性。",
        "Tyrion: 总之，[p/]先考虑一下其他选项吧。",
        "Tyrion: 唔……[p/]我想不出别人了。",
        "Lucio: 对。[p/]每个可能项都有漏洞。",
        "Lucio: 你的逻辑就有问题。",
        "那[i]你[/i]倒是说个没有问题的……",
        "Tyrion: ……",
        "Tyrion: ……有什么我没发现的事。",
        "Tyrion: 但我已经很接近了。",
        "Tyrion: 还缺少一块把所有事情联系起来的拼图。",
        "Lucio: ……不管怎样。[p/]我们还是不知道“无序女皇”是谁。",
        "Lucio: 我坚决不会让这种人在维文加德逍遥。",
        "Tyrion: 巨龙殿下。[p/]您在维文加德和魔力出现伊始就已在世。",
        "Tyrion: 您知道这个恶魔是谁吗？",
        "Rath: 并不知道……",
        "Rath: 恶魔一生会多次改变头衔。",
        "Rath: ……不管这个女皇是谁，[p/]敢这样侵犯我的领域也是好胆量。",
        "Tyrion: ……哎，[p/]看来我们只能顺其自然了。",
        "Rath: 我们今天已经获取了很多信息。[p/]但从中也衍生出更多问题。",
        "Rath: 应该怎么继续呢？",
        "Tyrion: ……唔呃。",
        "Rath: ……怎么了，卡斯伯特先生？",
        "Tyrion: 我总觉得有什么错过的事。",
        "Tyrion: 但我不知道是什么。",
        "Rath: 我们也纠结这件事好一阵子了。",
        "Rath: 也许应该暂时休庭，整理线索。",
        "Lucio: 哼……[p/]检方没有意见。",
        "Lucio: 这也能让[i]我的[/i]人检查今天的新发现。",
        "Rath: 就这么定了。",
        "Rath: 审理暂时推迟。",
        "Rath: 但明天早上大家要返回这里继续。",
        "Lucio: 你们现在都可以回家了。",
        "Lucio: 但别误会！",
        "Lucio: 国王卫队[i]会[/i]仔细关注你们[i]所有人[/i]。",
        "你还是感觉如芒在背。",
        "Celeste: 喂……[p/]提利昂？",
        "感觉自己忘记了重要的事情。",
        "Celeste: ……提利昂？",
        "是什么？什么这么重要却难以回想？！",
        "Celeste: 提利昂！",
        "Tyrion: 哦、[p/][s/]哦！[p/][s/]不、[p/][s/]不好意思……",
        "Tyrion: 我在思考发生的事。",
        "Celeste: 你看起来累坏了。[p/]要不要回家休息？",
        "Tyrion: 不……[p/]离下次庭审只有一天时间。",
        "Tyrion: 如果不能在明天之前弄明白发生了什么，[p/]魔法痕迹就会消失。",
        "Celeste: 但你已经[i]知道[/i]发生了什么，只是不知道犯人。",
        "Tyrion: 可能吧……[p/]我们应该再和嫌疑人谈一谈。",
        "Tyrion: 运气好的话，[p/]荷鲁斯之眼能告诉我什么事。",
        "Celeste: 可嫌疑人之一是夺眼者……",
        "Celeste: 他的话怎么办？",
        "Tyrion: ……只能也和他谈谈了。",
        "Celeste: 什么？！[p/][s/]不行！",
        "Celeste: 他再想杀你怎么办？！",
        "Tyrion: 阿莉亚命悬一线。",
        "Tyrion: 我只能冒这个险。",
        "Celeste: 提、[p/][s/]提利昂……[p/]你知道自己什么处境吗？",
        "Tyrion: ……什么？",
        "Celeste: 有人杀害了几个贵族，[p/]还攻击了皇室成员。",
        "Celeste: 古龙和恶魔领主也被卷进来了。",
        "Celeste: 这超出你的能力范围了吧？",
        "Tyrion: ……",
        "Tyrion: 痛诶。",
        "Celeste: 你[i]知道[/i]我不是那个意思。",
        "Celeste: 我只是说这事儿太[i]邪门[/i]了！",
        "Tyrion: 没关系的。[p/]和其他我们调查过的事一样。",
        "Celeste: 不一样！",
        "Celeste: 无序女皇攻击你怎么办？",
        "Celeste: 签约人觉得你太接近真相的话怎么办？！",
        "Celeste: 万……[p/][s/]万一我保护不了……？",
        "她的声音开始颤抖。",
        "Tyrion: 塞莱斯特……？",
        "Tyrion: ……",
        "Tyrion: 你[i]还在[i]担心之前的事？",
        "Tyrion: 没事的。[p/]我也说了你没有做错。",
        "Celeste: ……",
        "Celeste: 提利昂，你差点死了。",
        "Tyrion: ……我知道。",
        "Celeste: 提利昂……",
        "Celeste: 你。[p/][s/]差点。[p/][s/]死了！",
        "Tyrion: [i]我明白[/i]。塞莱斯特。",
        "Celeste: 不对！[p/][s/]你不明白！",
        "Celeste: 你知道她越过我离开时我有多担心？！",
        "Celeste: 看到你躺在地上……我、[p/][s/]我……",
        "Celeste: 我想了好多好多事……",
        "Celeste: 如果你真的……我不知道自己会……",
        "她甚至说不完那句话。",
        "Tyrion: 塞莱斯特……[p/]我……",
        "你太专注于其他事，忽视了她的感受。",
        "她被阿莉亚攻击，也差点死了。",
        "你甚至没想过这会给她造成多严重的创伤。",
        "Tyrion: ……",
        "Tyrion: ……对不起。[p/]我没有……",
        "Celeste: 别道歉。[p/]但[i]求你了[/i]……",
        "Celeste: 让卢西奥和鳞甲领主来处理吧。",
        "Celeste: 你做得够多了。[p/]他们可以解决之后的事。",
        "Tyrion: ……",
        "Tyrion: ……如果他们解决不了呢？",
        "Celeste: 我……",
        "Tyrion: 我也不会目中无人到觉得没了我就不行。",
        "Tyrion: 可他们要是[i]找不出[/i]签约人呢？",
        "Tyrion: 阿莉亚余生都要承受牢狱之灾。",
        "Tyrion: 如果我能帮她避免这个命运呢？",
        "Celeste: 我……",
        "Celeste: 我不在乎……",
        "Tyrion: 塞莱斯特！",
        "Celeste: 我不在乎，提利昂！",
        "Celeste: 之后我怎么对她道歉都可以！",
        "Celeste: 但我只想要你平安！",
        "Celeste: ……我不知道自己还会不会坚持下去。",
        "此话一出，[i]她自己[/i]也被吓到了……",
        "Celeste: ……我、[p/][s/]我很抱歉。[p/]我不是要——",
        "Tyrion: ……",
        "Tyrion: 我生命中有你真的很开心。",
        "Celeste: ……什、[p/][s/]什么？！",
        "Tyrion: 我知道你是关心我才这么说。",
        "Tyrion: 最近对你关心不够我也很抱歉。但是……",
        "Celeste: ……你不会停下来的，对吧。",
        "Tyrion: 我一直这么说……",
        "Celeste: *叹气*[p/]人、[p/]王、[p/]亦或是神。谁都不能阻止你为了委托人追求正义。",
        "Celeste: ……",
        "Celeste: 我去和卢西奥谈谈。",
        "Tyrion: 什么？",
        "Celeste: 如果要和夺眼者再会，[p/]就要带上骑士以防万一。",
        "Tyrion: 塞莱斯特……[p/]不是这么——",
        "Celeste: 不行！[p/][s/]你没有决定权！",
        "Celeste: 如果你趁我不在偷偷跑掉，[p/]我也[i]一定会[/i]找到你。",
        "从表情来看，[p/]她是认真的。",
        "Tyrion: 好、[p/][s/]好吧。[p/]你快去。",
        "不过她也有道理……",
        "这些事情发生前，[p/]你也不确定自己想不想继续当律师。",
        "一切结束后也许应该换种更安全，更宁静的生活。",
        "……和她一起生活。",
        "……",
        "等等……[p/][s/]想什么呢？！",
        "Celeste: 好了。[p/]卢西奥同意了。",
        "Celeste: 没想到说服他这么容易。",
        "Tyrion: 喔、[p/][s/]哦……[p/]呃、[p/][s/]唔嗯……",
        "Celeste: ……你没事吧？",
        "Tyrion: 没、[p/][s/]没事……[p/]我们快走吧。",
        "在她回答之前，[p/]你就快步走开了。",
        "Celeste: 等！[p/][s/]别走这么远！",
        "为了救出阿莉亚，得专心于准备庭审。",
        "但一切结束之后，也许可以……",
        "……",
        "嗯、[p/][s/]嗯……[p/]现在先不想这些。",
        "Rath: ……",
        "Eris: 你好呀，巨龙大人。[p/]我们应该是初次见面。",
        "Eris: ……你比我想的小只喔。",
        "Rath: ……",
        "Gallery：这个女的是谁？！",
        "Gallery: 怎么能带[i]普通人[/i]见鳞甲领主？",
        "Tyrion: 旁听的人们。[p/]感谢你们耐心等待。",
        "Tyrion: 至今，[p/]我们都以为这位女性叫厄莉斯·伊尔马特。",
        "Tyrion: 屠杀发生后，[p/]我们一直在寻找真正的幕后黑手。",
        "Tyrion: 我们只知道阿莉亚与叫做“无序女皇”的恶魔签订了血契。",
        "Tyrion: 但对这个恶魔知之甚少。",
        "Tyrion: 我们不知道这个恶魔是谁，长什么样。",
        "Tyrion: 但现在我们知道真相了。",
        "Tyrion: 维文加德的贵族们。[p/]证人席上的女性[i]不是[/i]普通人。",
        "Tyrion: 她就是无序女皇！",
        "Tyrion: 我不明白[i]原理[/i]。但她利用了人类的形态。",
        "Tyrion: 借此伪装，[p/]她以比亚特丽丝·弗雷加向导的身份进入大教堂。",
        "Tyrion: 之后她利用比亚特丽丝·弗雷加，协助操控阿莉亚·斯蒂尔文德的签约人杀害贵族。",
        "Lucio: 还需要继续吗？",
        "Lucio: 她已经承认自己参加了屠杀！",
        "Lucio: 只要逼问出签约人是谁就结束了！",
        "Eris: 哎呦，[p/]太典了。",
        "Eris: 以为暴力能解决[i]一切[/i]问题的大将军。",
        "Eris: 那我问问你。[p/]你怎么就觉得签约人是人类？",
        "Tyrion: ……什么？",
        "Eris: 在阿莉亚的契约里，[p/]“签约人”是[i]给予[/i]她合同的个体。",
        "Eris: 你怎么知道[i]我[/i]不是这个“个体”？",
        "Eris: 我有很多名字。[p/]“无序女皇”只是其中之一。",
        "Lucio: 哼……[p/]即使你没撒谎，[p/]也只是让事情更简单。",
        "Lucio: 我们只要因对王国的罪而执行[i]你的[/i]死刑即可。",
        "Eris: 你这脑袋已经忘了弗雷加案里我的属下说过什么？",

        "Eris: 但你得知她其实是和我签约血契后。",

        "Lucio: ……",

        "Eris: ……也很好奇你还能坚持多久。",
        "Eris: 没错。[p/]我就是幕后主使。",
        "Eris: 我知道国王的葬礼在大教堂举办。[p/]就强迫比亚特丽丝·弗雷加让我和她同行。",
        "Eris: 到达之后，[p/]我利用自己与比亚特丽丝·弗雷加和阿莉亚·斯蒂尔文德的契约，操控她们行动。",
        "Eris: 通过比亚特丽丝·弗雷加和阿莉亚·斯蒂尔文德的行动，[p/]我协助杀害了洛伊德·冯·桑克图斯，[p/]卡洛琳·希比尔，[p/]加里克·皮尔斯。",
        "Eris: 我唯一的动机就是要伤害提利昂·卡斯伯特的朋友，使他痛苦。",

        "Eris: 当然啦。[p/]我可是个恶魔。",
        "Eris: 既然撒不了谎，[p/]那我觉得还是尽量详细好一点。",
        "Eris: 这样的话也不会有质疑空间。",
        "Eris: 是不是妙极了，提利昂？",
        "唔呃……[p/]她肯定在耍你。",
        "她也许不能说谎。[p/]但这么做也绝不是出于好心。",
        "应该更仔细检查她的证言。",
        "Eris: 没错。[p/]我就是幕后主使。",

        "Eris: 哎呀，[p/]比亚特丽丝·弗雷加和阿莉亚·斯蒂尔文德帮了不少忙。",
        "Eris: 所以不能算独立。",
        "Tyrion: 你知道我什么意思。",
        "Eris: 我懂，我懂。[p/]这不是忍不住吗。",
        "Eris: 简单来说，[p/]那天没有人类[i]自愿[/i]协助我执行计划。",
        "你知道她[i]不能[/i]说谎。",
        "但她还是有很多欺骗别人的经验。",
        "应该时刻保持警惕。",
        "Eris: 我知道国王的葬礼在大教堂举办。[p/]就强迫比亚特丽丝·弗雷加让我和她同行。",

        "Eris: 噢，提利昂。[p/]我不可能对你和盘托出的呀，对不对？",

        "Tyrion: 省省吧。[p/]我们[i]都[/i]知道阿莉亚不是在自愿知情前提下签约的。",
        "Eris: ……这不是你的一厢情愿？",
        "Tyrion: ……什么？",
        "Eris: 你怎么就知道她签约时不知情？",

        "Eris: 真的？[p/]那要是我拿她未婚夫要挟呢？",
        "Lucio: ……",
        "Eris: 你可能觉得阿莉亚是什么正义使者。",
        "Eris: 但每个人都有自己的临界点。",
        "Tyrion: 如果你所言非虚，[p/]就告诉我们阿莉亚签约的详情吧。",
        "Eris: ……",
        "如你所料。[p/]她只是试图让你慌乱。",
        "即使是为了保护阿斯特，[p/]阿莉亚也绝对不会签这种契约。",
        "Eris: 通过比亚特丽丝·弗雷加和阿莉亚·斯蒂尔文德的行动，[p/]我协助杀害了洛伊德·冯·桑克图斯，[p/]卡洛琳·希比尔，[p/]加里克·皮尔斯。",
        "Tyrion: 为什么要用全名？",
        "Eris: 因为我不能说谎呀。[p/]那不如就说详细点。",
        "Eris: 因为嘛，[p/]和我签约的[p/]斯蒂尔文德一族与弗雷加一组成员[p/]多的是[p/]。",
        "Eris: 多到数不清喔。",
        "Lucio: ……",
        "Tyrion: 卢西奥，别理她。[p/]她故意要激怒你。",
        "Tyrion: 总之……[p/]除开皮尔斯，冯·桑克图斯和希比尔都是维文加德贵族圈的重要人物。",
        "Tyrion: 为什么要把他们三人一起杀了？",
        "Eris: 嗯……[p/]我没有理由。",
        "Tyrion: ……什么？",
        "Eris: 我没有杀他们的理由。[p/]只是[i]恰好[/i]帮他们去死了。",

        "Tyrion: 但这没道理啊！",
        "Eris: 是没有。",

        "Eris: 有帮助吧？",
        "Tyrion: 我……[p/]好吧……[p/]可能吧。",

        "Eris: 我要杀[i]他们[/i]没有特定的理由。[p/]我只需要阿莉亚尽可能高效快速地杀掉我要杀的人。",
        "Tyrion: 我们已经知道皮尔斯是因知道塞莱斯特亲生父母的身份被杀。",
        "Tyrion: 你怎么可能没有杀人动机？！",
        "Eris: ……这不是你的一厢情愿？",
        "Tyrion: 不是的！[p/][s/]这是唯一合理的结论！",
        "Eris: 这就是你的错了。",
        "Eris: 怎么能假定我的行为出于逻辑思考呢。",
        "Tyrion: ……",
        "你有点黔驴技穷了……",
        "之前调查过的谋杀案都有逻辑可循，你可以在此基础上推理。",

        "Eris: 杀人实在是太[i]容易[/i]了。[p/]小孩子都能做到。",

        "Tyrion: ……",

        "Celeste: 说了谎很抱歉……[p/]但我必须有不在场证明。",
        "Tyrion: 塞莱斯特！[p/][s/]裁判所是因为[i]你的[/i]证言才逮捕了她！",
        "Rath: ……阿拉里克王子和议长的证言也都指向她。",
        "Rath: 斯蒂尔文德小姐也知道自己口袋里发现的紫色标记很可疑。",
        "Rath: 不管有没有麦考伊的证言，[p/]事情走向都不会变。",
        "Lucio: ……",
        "Lucio: 麦考伊，你发现她们的时候，弗雷加和恶魔在干什么？",
        "Celeste: 她们骗过我进了祷告室……[p/]这之后，[p/]比亚特丽丝……[p/]杀害了你。",
        "Tyrion: 她们怎么能这么轻易骗过你？",
        "Celeste: 我出去看怎么回事的时候，[p/]只看到比亚特丽丝和厄莉斯站在守卫的尸体旁边。",
        "Celeste: 她们表现得像是凶手[i]另有其人[/i]。",
        "Celeste: 然后他们谎称进祷告室是要保护里面的人。",
        "Celeste: 比亚特丽丝……[p/]就是这时……",
        "Tyrion: ……",
        "Tyrion: 比亚特丽斯怎么杀的我？",
        "Celeste: 她对你用了某种[b]死灵术[/b] ，[p/]但没有造成外伤。",
        "Celeste: 我检查时[p/]你的尸体已经变冷……[p/]心跳也停止了。",
        "Celeste: 我认为她用了[b]索命咒[/b]。",
        "Tyrion: 所以阿斯克勒庇俄斯勋爵会说我身上有[b]死灵术[/b]的痕迹。",
        "她说尝试治疗你肯定也是撒谎。",
        "Tyrion: ……我死后你做了什么？",
        "Celeste: ……",
        "Celeste: 我不知道怎么办。[p/]这时厄莉斯跟我说，她能复活你，但我要杀掉皮尔斯。",
        "Tyrion: ……我不觉得她一开始就是这个目的。",
        "Tyrion: 她想让你和她签约。[p/]都是为了让[i]我[/i]痛苦。",
        "Celeste: 提利昂……[p/]我真的——！",
        "Tyrion: 别说了。",
        "Tyrion: 不要……[p/]说了。",
        "Tyrion: 我……",
        "Celeste: 我知道自己不应该这么做。[p/]但我只想让你回来……[p/]我不在乎自己会变成什么样。",
        "Tyrion: 你怎么能觉得这样没问题？！",
        "Celeste: 我知道自己不对……[p/]但我没办法……",
        "Celeste: 对不起。[p/]我不知道怎么办。",
        "Lucio: ……",
        "Rath: 现在不是谴责她的时候，卡斯伯特先生。",
        "Rath: ……之后还有很多时间。",
        "Tyrion: ……",
        "Celeste: 我没想到她会利用“永世服从”这点来操控我。[p/]她利用我骗阿莉亚签了[i]另一份[/i]血契。",
        "Tyrion: 确实……[p/]这一部分写得有点让人误会。",
        "Lucio: 她肯定以为女皇会把她召入地狱当仆从。",
        "Lucio: 但恶魔却选择立刻操控麦考伊。",
        "Lucio: ……你不该相信恶魔的。",
        "Celeste: ……",
        "Tyrion: ……总之，[p/]你是怎么骗阿莉亚签约血契的？",
        "Celeste: 是的……我没法控制自己的行动。[p/]但我记得发生了什么。",
        "Celeste: 她可能[i]想[/i]让我亲眼看到自己做了什么。",
        "Celeste: 我、[p/][s/]我真的……[p/][s/]真的很抱歉……",
        "Rath: ……",
        "Celeste: 我对阿莉亚说皮尔斯愿意用我父母的信息换取减刑。",
        "Celeste: 厄莉斯让比亚特丽丝对契约施加了[b]幻象术[/b]，让内容看起来像是要求上诉。",
        "Celeste: ……由于皮尔斯被控杀害我的父亲，[p/]她尊重我的意愿。",
        "……等等。[p/]她刚才说的有什么根本上的错误。",
        "Celeste: 在这之后……[p/]我按照契约里对[i]我[/i]的要求行动。[p/]为了让提利昂复活，我杀了皮尔斯。",
        "Tyrion: 这不是……",
        "Tyrion: 你怎么能觉得我会接受这种事，塞莱斯特？！",
        "Celeste: 我知道你不会。[p/][s/]但这不公平！",
        "Celeste: 为什么[i]那种人[/i]可以活着而你非死不可？",

        "Celeste: ……什么？",
        "Tyrion: 可能厄莉斯改变过[i]我的[/i]记忆，[p/][s/]但这跟改变一件实体证据可不一样！",
        "Lucio: 可我们还不清楚她的所有能力。[p/]真的能排除这个可能性吗？",
        "Lucio: 你当时失去了意识。[p/]伊尔马特有充足的时间修改记忆[i]并[/i]浏览你的随身物品。",

        "Celeste: 跟着她进入祷告室后，[p/]我发现比亚特丽丝和厄莉斯也在屋内。[p/]她们使阿莉亚、[p/]提利昂，[p/]还有皮尔斯失去了意识。",

        "Celeste: 皮尔斯死亡几分钟后，[p/]阿斯特、[p/]裁判所和国王卫队到场逮捕阿莉亚。",

        "Tyrion: 即使[i]看起来[/i]没什么重要的事，[p/]我还是希望进行交叉讯问。",
        "Lucio: 唔……[p/]那你开始吧。",
        "Celeste: 现在我想起来了。[p/]我们下午 1:50 去和皮尔斯见面。[p/]下午 2:20 听到外面的骚乱。",
        "Tyrion: 没错……[p/]我们已经确认会面时间[i]是[/i]下午 2:00。",
        "Celeste: 对……[p/]她只改变了我的记忆，妄图骗过所有人。",
        "Tyrion: 考虑到[i]我的[/i]记忆完好无缺，[p/]她的力量肯定无法改变别人的记忆。",
        "Lucio: 是的……[p/]她也没有用自己的恶魔之力复活你。",
        "Lucio: 她只是操控比亚特丽丝用了[b]假死[/b]法术。",
        "Celeste: ……不敢相信我会被这骗了。",
        "Tyrion: 总之……[p/]你看到了谁攻击看守？[p/]是阿莉亚或者比亚特丽丝吗？",
        "Celeste: 我看见阿莉亚在攻击看守。[p/]我和她缠斗了大概 15 分钟，才被她逃走。",
        "Tyrion: 一开始，[p/]你口中自己和她搏斗的时间长得[i]多[/i]。",
        "Celeste: 是的。[p/]我必须把自己和厄莉斯交谈的时间也算在内。",
        "Lucio: 我就[i]感觉[/i]哪里不对。",
        "Celeste: 我知道提利昂会很关注谋杀时间线的细节。",
        "Celeste: 所以我必须让自己的证言和皮尔斯死亡事件一致。",
        "Tyrion: ……",
        "Celeste: ……我[i]真的[/i]很抱歉。",
        "Tyrion: ……这个我们之后谈。",
        "Celeste: ……",
        "Celeste: 跟着她进入祷告室后，[p/]我发现比亚特丽丝和厄莉斯也在屋内。[p/]她们使阿莉亚、[p/]提利昂，[p/]还有皮尔斯失去了意识。",
        "Tyrion: 所以比亚特丽丝在你们搏斗时偷偷溜进去这点没错。",
        "Celeste: 对……[p/]现在想想，[p/]可能是为了转移我的注意，让比亚特丽丝潜入。",
        "Tyrion: 嗯……",
        "Lucio: 怎么了，卡斯伯特？",
        "Tyrion: 如果签约人在和厄莉斯[i]合作[/i]，为什么不让厄莉斯操控比亚特丽丝使阿莉亚昏迷？",
        "Celeste: 我没考虑过这点……",
        "Lucio: ……说实话，[p/]我很难相信签约人会乐意遵照女皇复杂的计划。",
        "Lucio: 签约人明显[i]需要[/i]皮尔斯去死。[p/]只靠麦考伊有点太蠢了。",
        "确实……[p/]有没有可能是厄莉斯不照计划行事？",
        "她确实不像那种会乖乖听人类指示的恶魔。",
        "Tyrion: ……总之，[p/]你看到失去意识的我之后发生了什么？",
        "Celeste: ……我检查了提利昂，认为他死了。[p/]但现在想想，比亚特丽丝可能对他用了[b]假死[/b]。",
        "Lucio: ……你会中这么明显的骗术真令我难以置信。",
        "Celeste: 我知道……[p/]我当时太害怕了。",
        "Celeste: 我以为提利昂死了。[p/]我脑袋不清醒。",
        "Tyrion: ……很高兴你这么在乎我。",
        "Tyrion: ……但你也几乎毁掉了阿莉亚的前程。",
        "Celeste: ……",
        "Rath: ……也许还是要专注于事实。",
        "Celeste: 总之，[p/]厄莉斯向我提出交易。[p/]但我受不了要杀皮尔斯……[p/]你们也知道后续。",
        "Lucio: ……一份血契竟然能对调查有这么大影响。",
        "Celeste: 我早该知道她有其他打算……[p/]但我当时太急迫了，意识不到。",

        "Lucio: ……",
        "鳞甲领主对她一直很温柔……",
        "Celeste: 皮尔斯死亡几分钟后，[p/]阿斯特、[p/]裁判所和国王卫队到场逮捕阿莉亚。",
        "Lucio: 一定是在他们去调查公共休息室火势之后。",
        "Tyrion: 我没想到阿斯特也去了祷告室。[p/]我还以为国王卫队会让他留在某个安全地点。",
        "Lucio: ……我的命令确实如此。",

        "Tyrion: ……",
        "Lucio: 需要我提醒你时间[i]所剩无几[/i]吗？",
        "Lucio: 不要浪费时间了，有话就说！",
        "Tyrion: ……塞莱斯特。[p/]加里克·皮尔斯在下午 2:45 身亡，[i]阿斯特[/i]几分钟后就现身祷告室。",
        "Celeste: 对……[p/]你想说什——？",
        "Celeste: 等等……",
        "Tyrion: 这就产生一个大问题。",
        "Tyrion: 阿斯特怎么能在下午 2:45 前后进祷告室的？",
        "Tyrion: ……明明他直到[i]下午 3:00[/i] 都[i]应该[/i]被困在[b]坚牢术[/b]里！",
        "Lucio: ……！",
        "Celeste: 等、[p/][s/]等等……[p/][s/]你在说笑吧？！",
        "Lucio: 麦、[p/][s/]麦考伊的记忆明显不可靠！",
        "Lucio: 我的人[i]一致[/i]报告说，国王陛下在[b]坚牢术[/b]解除[i]之后[/i]才带他们去了祷告室。",
        "Tyrion: 一般而言……[p/]这[i]会[/i]比塞莱斯特的证言更可靠。",
        "Tyrion: 但我们不能相信他们的证言。",
        "Lucio: 你在说什么？！",
        "Tyrion: 在我检查塞莱斯特的契约时，[p/]厄莉斯表示她和多名卫队成员也签了契约。",
        "Lucio: 什么？！",
        "Tyrion: 他们也与她同流合污。",
        "Tyrion: 如果这些契约和塞莱斯特的契约组内容相似，[p/]她肯定也能改变这些人的记忆。",
        "Tyrion: 也就意味着他们被讯问时可能有意[i]或[/i]无意撒谎。",
        "Rath: 竟然……[p/]就连[i]国王卫队[/i]也遭毒手……",
        "Rath: 我怎么会让这种事发生……？",
        "Tyrion: 即使我们假定他能逃出[i]无法逃脱的[/i][b]坚牢术[/b]，[p/]阿斯特又是怎么[i]知道[/i]要去祷告室的？",
        "Lucio: 我、[p/][s/]我明白你的论点……",
        "Lucio: 但你[i]明白[/i]自己在暗示什么吗？！",
        "Tyrion: 我不是想暗示什么。[p/]我只是在陈述已知事实。",
        "Tyrion: 我们知道一个人类，[p/]不论是自愿还是其他原因，[p/]与无序女皇一起谋划了这场屠杀。",
        "Tyrion: 他深得阿莉亚·斯蒂尔文德信任。",
        "Tyrion: 信任到她甚至不[i]多想[/i]就签了他递过来的契约。",
        "Tyrion: 只有一个满足这些条件的人……",
        "Tyrion: ……阿斯特·维文加德：[p/][s/]我们的现任国王！",
        "Rath: 肃静！[p/][s/]我让你们肃静！",
        "Rath: ……",
        "Rath: 卡斯伯特先生……[p/]你明白这一指控的重大意义吗？",
        "Rath: 指控国王和任何恶魔同谋犯案，[p/]都不是小事。",
        "Tyrion: 我明白。[p/]但我[i]希望[/i]这只是个误会。",
        "Tyrion: 毕竟，[p/]厄莉斯的目的似乎只是尽可能收获混乱无序。",
        "Tyrion: 她骗我们相信塞莱斯特和阿莉亚[i]都是[/i]杀人犯。",
        "Tyrion: 我想救阿莉亚。[p/]但我也想相信愿意信任我的人们。",
        "Tyrion: 如果阿斯特有什么能救阿莉亚的情报，[p/]我们就必须找出来。",
        "Rath: ……那好吧。",
        "Rath: 看来只有这么做了，[p/]事已至此，[p/]国王也必须分享他的真相。",
        "Tyrion: 我同意。[p/]这一点我也不会让步。",
        "Lucio: ……",
        "Lucio: 国王卫队！[p/][s/]护送国王陛下上证人席！",
        "Aster: ……",
        "Tyrion: ……感谢你的合作，阿斯特。",
        "Aster: 当然。[p/]我明白你的处境，卡斯伯特先生。",
        "Tyrion: 我希望你能就阿莉亚一开始怎么会签约血契做出说明。",
        "Tyrion: 厄莉斯有可能骗了你，导致[i]你[/i]实施屠杀。",
        "Tyrion: 尽管证据指向这里，[p/]但一定有什么我们还没发现的东西。",
        "Aster: 证据？[p/]你说的是塞莱斯特的证言。[p/]我没说错吧？",
        "Aster: 很抱歉这么说，[p/]但是……",
        "Aster: 你确定我们能相信她的证言？",
        "Tyrion: 我们现在可以相信她。",
        "Tyrion: 她已经不受血契影响了。",
        "Aster: [i]你[/i]号称不受影响。",
        "Aster: ……但本来也只有[i]你[/i]有昭示血契的力量。",
        "Tyrion: ……你想说什么？",
        "Aster: 对不起，卡斯伯特先生。[p/]我想说的是……",
        "Aster: 发生刚才这些事后，[p/]我们怎么能相信你？",
        "Tyrion: ……什么？",
        "Aster: 你消失了好一阵子，[p/]去了[i]谁都不知道[/i]的地方。",
        "Aster: 与你同行的只有塞莱斯特和一个能改变别人记忆的[i]恶魔[/i]。",
        "Aster: 你一回来，这个恶魔[i]马上[/i]就燃烧殆尽，对你[i]有点[/i]太方便了？",
        "Aster: 她也说过好几次。[p/]这样做不能[i]真的[/i]杀掉她。",
        "Tyrion: 我、[p/][s/]我……",
        "Aster: [i]现在[/i]……[p/]你又要指控我是签约人，[p/]那个要对谋杀冯·桑克图斯和希比尔负责的人。",
        "Aster: 如果恶魔把你也控制了，[p/]这不就[i]正是[/i]她想要的？",
        "Rath: ……",
        "Gallery: ……说得对啊！",
        "Gallery: 我们怎么知道“天诞之物”值得信任？！",
        "Gallery: 我们都听说过那些故事！[p/][s/]他明显是个异见人士！",
        "Gallery: 就我们所知，[p/]他有可能是神权特工！",
        "你能感到周围传来的敌意……",
        "就连鳞甲领主都有些警惕……",
        "Aster: 对、[p/][s/]对不起！[p/][s/]我不是要攻击做了这么多的你。",
        "Aster: 不过我想还有[i]一种[/i]方法能确认你的理论。",
        "Tyrion: ……什么方法？",
        "Aster: 对我使用神谕。[p/]就像你之前做的那样。",
        "Aster: 如果我真的和那个恶魔[i]是[/i]一伙的，[p/]我们不应该签个契约吗？",
        "Aster: 就算我被改变记忆，[p/]契约也会出现。",
        "Tyrion: ……？！",
        "Celeste: 等等……[p/]就是这样！",
        "Celeste: 我们之前就试过了，但是契约没出现！",
        "Tyrion: ……这说明他们肯定[i]没有[/i]签契约。",
        "Aster: ……你还愣在那里干什么？",
        "Tyrion: 我……[p/]不能这么做。[p/]我之前试过了，但是什么也没发生。",
        "Aster: 原来如此……",
        "Aster: ……",
        "Aster: 我很抱歉，卡斯伯特先生。[p/]我知道你很在乎她。",
        "Aster: 但我们都看过了塞莱斯特的血契，[i]也[/i]听了她之前的忏悔。",
        "Aster: 更不用说，[p/]我们没法知道塞莱斯特是否[i]真的[/i]不再受厄莉斯影响。",
        "Aster: 如果要救斯蒂尔文德女士，[p/]我们就必须接受不得不做的事。",
        "Aster: 我不想这么说。[p/]但我认为是时候结束这场审判了。[p/]你认为呢，巨龙殿下？",
        "Rath: ……",
        "该死……[p/]就连鳞甲领主也站在他那边。",
        "即使对你不利，[p/]他的话也没什么问题.",
        "但他的表现有恶意吗？[p/]或者他只是太过谨慎？",
        "Celeste: 拜托！[p/][s/]快想想，提利昂！",
        "Celeste: 我们只证明了我的血契无效。",
        "Celeste: 但那个利用阿莉亚杀人的真凶还站在那。",
        "也许你的思路是错的。",
        "厄莉斯有的是方法骗人签下血契。",
        "她不一定[i]需要[/i]血契骗阿斯特帮她。",
        "问题不在于阿斯特是不是故意的。",
        "问题在于……",
        "这其中肯定会有[i]某些[/i]需要阿斯特物理介入的地方。",
        "[i]那种方式[/i]可能会留下证据。",
        "Player: 阿莉亚 被骗 签约 血契",
        "Player: Fail",
        "不……[p/]如果阿斯特真的[i]是[/i]签约人，[p/]他可以利用阿莉亚杀人。",
        "他不需要亲自参与。",
        "但有一件事[i]是[/i]他必须亲自做的。",
        "Tyrion: 他得想办法骗阿莉亚签契约……",
        "Celeste: ……但你也看到了她在他身边的时候是什么表现。",
        "Celeste: 这并不难做到。",
        "Tyrion: 不……[p/]阿莉亚可能是个十足的恋爱脑，[p/]但她还是个检察官。",
        "Tyrion: 她会仔细阅读[i]所有[/i]她要签订的合同。",
        "Tyrion: 我们之前推测她的血契被伪装成一份普通的法律文件。",
        "Tyrion: 但我想起来一件事。[p/]你瞥到契约内容的时候，[p/]立刻开始逗阿莉亚。",
        "Celeste: 我在努力想了，[p/]但还是记不起来我当时看到的是什么……",
        "Celeste: ……",
        "Celeste: 如果我会因为内容[i]逗[/i]她，[p/]那这契约可能与她和阿斯特的关系有关。",
        "Tyrion: ……！",
        "Celeste: 抱歉……[p/]这话好像没啥用。",
        "Tyrion: 不……[p/]这[i]正是[/i]我需要的线索。",
        "Celeste: 真的……？",
        "Player: 阿莉亚 签了 订婚 契约",
        "Player: Fail",
        "不……[p/]当塞莱斯特瞥到那份契约时，[p/]她立刻开始逗阿莉亚。",
        "她很喜欢拿阿莉亚对阿斯特的爱恋逗她。",
        "所以塞莱斯特看到的是什么文件？",
        "Tyrion: 阿斯特！[p/][s/]这里有[i]一件[/i]证物能证明你参与过此事。",
        "Aster: ……真的？",
        "Tyrion: ……签约人控制阿莉亚，不弄脏自己的手就完成了谋杀。",
        "Tyrion: 但这些都需要以骗她[i]签订[/i]契约为前提。",
        "Tyrion: 我记得你们在屠杀开始[i]前不久[/i]去和议长会面。",
        "Tyrion: 是为了要讨论你和阿莉亚结婚的事，对吧？",
        "Aster: ……是的。[p/]说得没错。",
        "Tyrion: 阿斯特，[p/]阿莉亚签约的血契必须[i]看起来像[/i]普通法律文件。",
        "Tyrion: 我刚阅读内容时意识到了一些事。",
        "Tyrion: 正文里的内容在某种[i]不同[/i]情况下也可以使用。",
        "Tyrion: 这份契约里，[p/]阿莉亚将献出自己的“意识，[p/]躯体，[p/]灵魂”。",
        "Tyrion: [i]双方[/i]生存期间都会被一直联系在一起。",
        "Lucio: 等等……[p/][s/]你是在说——？！",
        "Rath: 不……",
        "Tyrion: 换句话说，[p/]“直至死亡将你们分开”！",
        "Aster: 我……",
        "Lucio: 就算是你，[p/]这逻辑也太跳跃了。",
        "Lucio: 骗了我女儿的[i]那个人[/i]肯定已经把证据销毁了。",
        "Lucio: 恶魔还不辞辛苦把她的记忆也修改了。",
        "Lucio: 我不觉得会留下任何有关婚约的证据。",
        "Rath: 确实如此。[p/]不能只靠猜测就对议长[i]或[/i]国王进行这么严重的指控。",
        "Gallery: 他先是[i]胆敢[/i]让国王作证……[p/][s/][i]现在[/i]又要指控议长？！",
        "Gallery: 他是个叛国者！",
        "Tyrion: 巨龙殿下，我不是只靠猜测。",
        "Tyrion: ……我有婚约的副本。",
        "Aster: 但、[p/]但是你的神谕只能复现血契的条款，[p/]不能复现载体。",
        "Aster: 原始文件在你的副本上是看不见的。",
        "Tyrion: ……我说的不是那份[p/]“副本”，阿斯特。",
        "Aster: ……什、[p/][s/]什么？",
        "Tyrion: 你就没想过我是[s/][i]怎么[/i]知道血契的？",
        "Tyrion: 每个律师和检察官都有自己的魔法符石。",
        "Tyrion: 符石可以用魔力拍摄现场照片，记录笔记。",
        "Aster: 是、[p/]是的……[p/]我了解这些……",
        "Tyrion: ……那你知道阿莉亚对自己签的婚约拍了照吗？",
        "Aster: ……什么？",
        "Tyrion: 终于能和你结为夫妻让她十分开心，[p/]开心到要拍照纪念这份“婚约”。",
        "Tyrion: ……即使这[i]照理来说[/i]是违法的。",
        "Aster: ……她、[p/][s/]她——！[p/][s/]她怎么会——？！",
        "Tyrion: 意识恢复的瞬间，[p/]她以为自己会对别人造成威胁。",
        "Tyrion: 她[i]没有[/i]自己那天做了什么的记忆，[p/]但她清楚有哪里不对。",
        "Tyrion: 所以她才把自己关在有[b]抗魔力场[/b]的牢房里。",
        "Tyrion: 她的小心谨慎[i]合乎情理[/i]。",
        "Tyrion: 但如果她能暂时离开[b]抗魔力场[/b]的范围，检查一下自己的符石……",
        "Tyrion: ……她就会发现一张照片，照片里的婚约内容和自己的血契完全一致！",
        "Tyrion: 让我问问你，阿斯特。",
        "Tyrion: 这份婚约是谁给她的？",
        "Tyrion: 你还是议长？",
        "Aster: ……",
        "Tyrion: 如果你不想回答，[p/]我们也可以让议长来作证。",
        "Aster: *叹气*[p/]不用麻烦了。",
        "Tyrion: 不……[p/]所以真的[i]是[/i]你。",
        "Aster: ……卡斯伯特先生，告诉我。[p/]你知道最好的谎言是什么吗？",
        "Tyrion: 最难被证伪的。",
        "Aster: 不……[p/]不太对。",
        "Aster: 是你都不会尝试证伪的。",
        "Aster: 最好的是让你[i]想要[/i]相信的谎言。",
        "Aster: 真相可能就摆在你眼前，[p/]但这谎言会让你看向别处。",
        "Aster: 如果我记得没错，[p/]麦考伊今天就给了你这种体验。",
        "Rath: 国王殿下。[p/]你这是——？",
        "Aster: 我受够这出闹剧了。",
        "Aster: 如果让议长上证人席，[p/]卡斯伯特先生也会[i]推理[/i]出相同结论。",
        "Aster: 我看，早晚都要变成这样的。",
        "Aster: 也许我只是在对自己撒谎。",
        "Lucio: 你、[p/][s/]你——！",
        "Lucio: 国王殿……[p/]不……",
        "Lucio: 阿斯特，你这个畜生！",
        "Lucio: 你在说[i]是你[/i]干的？",
        "Lucio: 你[i]利用[/i]我女儿实施屠杀？！",
        "Aster: 是我，卢西奥。[p/]这又怎样？",
        "Rath: ……你[i]怎么能[/i]？！",
        "Aster: 而[i]你[/i]又有什么权力对我评头论足，[p/][i]伟大[/i]的鳞甲领主？！",
        "Aster: 我只不过是在打扫[i]你的[/i]烂摊子罢了！",
        "Aster: ……要不是厄莉斯的小游戏，[p/]我干得还会更[i]干净利落[/i]。",
        "Rath: 恕我没有听清？",
        "Aster: 不……[p/]我会饶恕我自己。",
        "Lucio: 你跟我开玩笑吧？！",
        "Aster: 我可[i]是[/i]维文加德国王，对吧？",
        "Aster: 赦免不是我的权力吗？",
        "Tyrion: ……你疯了。",
        "Aster: 告诉我。[p/]你们是不是都吓坏了？",
        "Aster: 被我可以为所欲为，[p/]没有任何人能阻止这一点？",
        "Aster: 这不正是[i]你们[/i]对这个国家其他人所做的事？",
        "Tyrion: 你真的指望这样脱罪？！",
        "Aster: 我确实这么指望。[p/]谁有阻止我的力量？",
        "Aster: 鳞甲领主？",
        "Tyrion: 呃……[i]对[/i]。[p/][i]正是[/i]他。",
        "Tyrion: 所以才会由他主持庭审。[p/]他的权威性在你之上。",
        "Aster: 提利昂，我问的不是谁能阻止我。[p/]而是谁[i]会[/i]阻止我。",
        "Rath: ……",
        "Lucio: ……",
        "Tyrion: 什么……？",
        "Tyrion: 你们怎么都不说话了？！",
        "Aster: 没错。[p/]拉萨利昂。[p/]逮捕我吧。",
        "Aster: 让我[i]七岁的[/i]小弟来继承王位。",
        "Aster: 你肯定从历史中学到了孩童执政会给国王带来[i]什么[/i]后果。",
        "Rath: ……",
        "Aster: 不然你也可以自己称王？",
        "Aster: 你数百年都蜷缩在这座城市遗迹里。",
        "Aster: 我敢肯定你[i]了解[/i]这个国家的问题，[i]了解[/i]该怎么重回正轨。",
        "Tyrion: 拉萨利昂！",
        "Rath: ……对不起，卡斯伯特先生。",
        "Rath: 我来此是为了做对我的子民最好的事。",
        "Rath: 我可能不知道最优秀的行动……",
        "Rath: 但我知道如果国家[i]失控[/i]的惨痛影响。",
        "Rath: 我不会再承担这个责任了。",
        "Rath: ……我也不会让[i]不应[/i]承受这一责任的人上任。",
        "Aster: 意料之中……",
        "Aster: 就我看到的事而言，[p/]疏忽大意一直是你的一贯特点[i]之一[/i]。",
        "Lucio: ……",
        "Aster: 那你呢，卢西奥？",
        "Aster: 你想尝试废黜我吗？",
        "Aster: 被人民所爱的前王子，[p/]现任维文加德国王。",
        "Aster: 还是说你忘了？[p/]国民们[i]热爱[/i]我，[i]痛恨[/i]你。",
        "Lucio: ……！",
        "Aster:我听说你很擅长“辩论”，提利昂。",
        "Aster: 但我想就连[i]你[/i]也不能让群众相信[i]这[/i]不是军事政变。",
        "Tyrion: ……",
        "Aster: 你能想象吗？",
        "Aster: 卢西奥大将军，[p/]在先王尸骨未寒之时，[p/]废黜维文加德新王。",
        "Aster: 我很好奇这会引起多么[i]血腥[/i]的内战。",
        "Aster: 再者，[i]就算[/i]卢西奥轻易镇压了平民……",
        "Aster: 你肯定也能想象弱化的维文加德在他国眼里多么诱人。",
        "该死！[p/][s/]杀掉希比尔和冯·桑克图斯以后，[p/]他留下了只有自己能填补的权力空缺。",
        "Tyrion: 阿斯特！[p/][s/]你这是以[i]整个[/i]王国当“人质”！",
        "Aster: 我不过是在巩固权力而已。",
        "Aster: 把权力集中在一个善良[i]仁慈[/i]的统治者里，[p/]由他之手来[i]治愈[/i]这个国家。",
        "Tyrion: 你[i]谋杀[/i]了好几个人，[p/][s/]与恶魔同流合污，[p/][s/]还让你自己的未婚妻[i]沦为仆从[/i]！",
        "Aster: 我很确定在[i]你[/i]眼里，[p/]我的行为天理不容，难以原谅。",
        "Aster: 但对于维文加德贵族来说，[p/]我可能都不是第一个这么做的。",
        "Aster: 这只是……[p/]政治。",
        "Aster: [i]这样[/i]就将军了，卡斯伯特。",
        "Tyrion: ……",
        "Aster: 真不敢信。[p/]我一直[i]想[/i]这么说说看。",
        "Celeste: 你们都在干什么？！",
        "Celeste: 就这么让他溜走了？！",
        "Rath: ……",
        "Lucio: ……",
        "Celeste: 卢西奥！[p/][s/]她可是你[i]女儿[/i]！",
        "Celeste: 你就要让他这么继续控制她？！",
        "Lucio: ……我的女儿不会为了自由牺牲维文加德的平稳。",
        "Lucio: 你也知道这是真的……",
        "Celeste: 这是——！",
        "Celeste: 他杀了这么多人，[i]还[/i]奴役了阿莉亚……",
        "Celeste: 他差点就杀了你，还[i]试图[/i]杀掉我……",
        "等一下……[p/][s/]就是这样！",
        "Tyrion: 他为什么要[i]试图[/i]杀掉你？",
        "Celeste: ……这是什么意思？",
        "Tyrion: 如果阿斯特就是签约人，[p/]意味着皮尔斯[i]原本[/i]把信寄给了[i]他[/i]。",
        "Tyrion: ……维文加德先王最近离世。",
        "Tyrion: 如果阿斯特觉得她有威胁，[p/]是否代表塞莱斯特也有皇室血统？",
        "Lucio: 这样说不通。",
        "Lucio: 即使麦考伊有皇室血统，[p/]阿斯特也是国王血统[i]纯正[/i]的长子。",
        "Lucio: 麦考伊甚至都摸不着王座的边。",
        "Tyrion: 如果你[i]是[/i]他同父异母的妹妹，[p/]那确实没有继承权。",
        "Tyrion: 那他又为什么要费这么大功夫杀害皮尔斯[i]和[/i]你？",
        "Celeste: 可能他只是想确保万无一失？",
        "Tyrion: 但如果重要性不大，他也不会让厄莉斯亲自杀掉皮尔斯……",
        "Tyrion: 他需要的是你[i]和[/i]皮尔斯都在屠杀中死亡。",
        "Tyrion: 这也代表你们的重要性不比冯·桑克图斯与希比尔低。",
        "Celeste: 好吧……？[p/]但他害怕我的原因只有我可能的继承权。",
        "Celeste: 如果[i]这[/i]都不是问题，[p/]为什么他还会那么害怕皮尔斯的恐吓信？",

        "回忆一下你知道的维文加德皇权相关法律。",
        "是不是有什么人提过什么事？",
        "巴哈姆特教堂",

        "Theon: 巴哈姆特教堂对维文加德的文化和社会秩序同等重要。",
        "Theon: 信仰是一种强大且有凝聚性的力量。",
        "Tyrion: ……这就是你修改维文加德历史，不让天诞之物入国的原因？",
        "Theon: 我不知道你在影射[i]什么[/i]。[mind=\"唔……他这样的异见人士会毁掉我们的文化。\"/]",
        "即使有这机会，阿斯特也没有杀掉议长。",
        "巴哈姆特教堂可能是他未来计划的一部分。",
        "但这解释不了他为什么要杀皮尔斯。",
        "卢米那的神权",
        "你想起了自己和比亚特丽丝·弗雷加的一段对话。",
        "Beatrice: 可能是因为维文加德与卢米那神权的血腥历史。",
        "Tyrion: 神权？[p/]你说我们东边那个国家？",
        "Beatrice: 是的。[p/]卢米那人崇拜天界神祇，[p/][i]我们[/i]则是崇拜古龙。",
        "Beatrice: 几个世纪之前，[p/]我国和卢米那国打过仗。",
        "Beatrice: 即使至今，[p/]皇家依然认为天界宗教对我们的龙族信仰是个威胁。",
        "Beatrice: 教堂竭尽全力抹杀了任何崇拜天界的宗教。",
        "唔……[p/]如果阿斯特的行动和神权相关，[p/]他针对的就该是[i]你[/i]而非塞莱斯特。",
        "这也解释不了他为什么要杀皮尔斯。",
        "鳞甲领主",
        "……你想起了自己和厄莉斯·伊尔马特的一段对话。",
        "Eris: 虽然发生了这么多，[p/]我国宪法依然把鳞甲领主包括在政府里。",
        "TYRION: 不是……[p/]说真的？",
        "ERIS: 作为王国的救世主，[p/]他和自己的血亲在政界有个荣誉职位。",
        "ERIS: 古龙的威权能匹敌国王。",
        "TYRION: 哇……[p/]我根本不知道。",
        "TYRION: 怎么我之前都没听说过？",
        "ERIS: 老实讲,[p/]这条法律只是为了讨好教堂，显示对他的尊敬罢了。",
        "等等……[p/]鳞甲领主[i]和[/i]他的血亲可以凌驾于国王之上……？",
        "Tyrion: ……",
        "Tyrion: 等等……",
        "与恶魔的契约",
        "你想起了自己和哈罗德·哈罗德森的一段对话。",
        "Tyrion: 噢，对了。[p/]噬法之剑传说是通过恶魔和法师的契约打造而成。",
        "Celeste: 和恶魔签约不是[i]自找[/i]麻烦？",
        "Celeste: 他们肯定会第一时间背叛你的。",
        "Harold: 这个嘛，传说里也说恶魔会起草血契来消除后顾之忧。",
        "Tyrion: 等等……[p/]你是说一份具有[i]法律约束力[/i]的契约？",
        "Harold: 差不多的意思。[p/]但一旦签约血契，[p/]你和恶魔都会被魔力约束，必须服从其中条款。",
        "Harold: 据传一旦违反其中款项，不管是恶魔还是人……[p/]都会立即死亡。",
        "Tyrion: 那看来还是[i]有点[/i]保护……",
        "Harold: 嗯……[p/]作为律师，[p/]你肯定清楚[i]任何[/i]契约里的漏洞都可以被利用。",
        "Harold: 根据传说，[p/]恶魔也对自己欺骗堕落人类的能力引以为荣。",
        "嗯……[p/]阿斯特[i]确实[/i]和无序女皇做了交易。",
        "但他们没有签约过血契。",
        "只是在利用彼此达成自己的目标。",
        "但这还是解释不了他为什么需要杀掉塞莱斯特或者皮尔斯。",
        "四大支柱家族",
        "你想起了自己和卡洛琳·希比尔的一段对话。",
        "Coraline: 平民称我们为“四大支柱”，[p/]每个成员家族都控制着王国政府的不同分支。",
        "Coraline: 斯蒂尔文德家掌管国防与执法机关。",
        "Coraline: 弗雷加家负责金融与经济发展。",
        "Coraline: 冯·桑克图斯家负责商业，[p/]本地和国际均有。",
        "Coraline: 最后，[p/]就是希比尔家。",
        "Coraline: 我们负责王国的立法与司法机关。",
        "Tyrion: ……所以我国司法系统是你负责的。",
        "Coraline: 正确。",
        "嗯……[p/]现在四大支柱家族三家领主已死，[p/]基本没人能挑战阿斯特。",
        "如果阿莉亚被栽赃，[p/]斯蒂尔文德家也会因此失势。",
        "阿斯特做这一切可能都是为了削弱贵族对他的威胁。",

        "Celeste: Right.[p/] He mentioned that he owed you a favor.",

        "You feel like you've seen her somewhere before.[p/] But you can't quite remember where.",
        "As soon as you enter the room,[p/] von Sanctus flashes a quick look of disdain at you.",
        "You see him slowly move his conversation out of the room as well.",
        "And finally,[p/] you see Lucio Steelwind speaking with his daughter.",
        "...along with the two princes.",
        "They seem to speaking with another individual that you haven't met before.",
        "When he notices you,[p/] his gaze narrows.[p/] And he stares at the two of you warily.",
