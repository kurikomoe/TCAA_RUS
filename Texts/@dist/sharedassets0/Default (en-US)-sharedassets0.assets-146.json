        "Judge: Said guard rail broke,[p/] causing Justin Waye to fall to his death.",
        "Judge: ...However,[p/] the defense presented a shocking piece of evidence in the previous proceedings.",
        "Judge: Traces of [b]transmutation[/b] magic were found on that same broken guard rail.",
        "Judge: This new evidence implies that sabotage,[p/] if not outright foul play,[p/] played a part in the death of the victim.",
        "Judge: This evidence is also accompanied by conflicting testimonies from witnesses.",
        "Judge: All of these elements have thrown quite some doubt on the validity of the prosecution's case.",
        "Aria: Yes.[p/] However,[p/] the prosecution maintains that the Dracogen Trading Company is at fault for Justin Waye's death.",
        "Judge: Even though someone may have sabotaged the guard rails?",
        "Aria: The prosecution acknowledges that sabotage [i]may[/i] have occurred at the scene of the accident.",
        "Aria: However,[p/] we also believe that there are several factors in this case that the court is overlooking.",
        "Aria: As we all know,[p/] several witnesses were present at the refinery at the time of the accident.",
        "Aria: The harbourmaster was showing a patron around the refinery.",
        "Aria: Mosourika Tudor was making a food delivery and entered the building.",
        "Aria: And of course,[p/] the victim:[p/] Justin Waye was obviously present as well.",
        "Aria: Each and every one of these people had no business [i]being[/i] in the refinery that night.",
        "Tyrion: In the case of the harbourmaster and his patron,[p/] it would be hardly reasonable for [i]anyone[/i] to stop them.",
        "You doubt anyone would stand in the way of the crown prince.",
        "Aria: ...That may be.[p/] But [i]Justin Waye[/i] worked in the freight division and should [i]not[/i] have been at the scene.",
        "Tyrion: I've already verified this with my client.",
        "Tyrion: The victim was not authorized to be in the refinery building.",
        "Aria: And who stopped Justin Waye from entering the area unauthorized?",
        "Aria: Isn't it the defendant's duty to prevent such individuals from entering the building?",
        "Tyrion: My client can't be held responsible for Justin's breach of the set protocols.",
        "Tyrion: And you surely can't hold my client responsible for someone [i]sabotaging[/i] the guard rail.",
        "Aria: This so-called \"sabotage\" is only theoretical until a proper culprit is found.",
        "Judge: Hm...[p/] I might be compelled to agree with you, Ms. Steelwind.",

        "Hard evidence means everything here...[p/] And the Rod of Mending has been reduced to shards in the vat...",
        "Without the complete rod,[p/] you can't prove that someone used it to sabotage the guard rail.",
        "Aria: Regardless,[p/] is it not the responsibility of the Dracogen Trading Company to ensure that its employees do not wander into restricted areas?",
        "Aria: Blaming a potential saboteur puts the cart before the horse.",
        "Aria: It doesn't just stop with Justin Waye either.",
        "Aria: Why was [i]Mosourika Tudor[/i] able to enter the building?",
        "Aria: She doesn't even work for the refinery,[p/] yet she was able to waltz into the building without any trouble.",
        "Actually,[p/] Steelwind [i]does[/i] have a point about Rika.",
        "Shouldn't something have stopped her from entering that area?",
        "You doubt that Dracogen would show that kind of negligence.",
        "Tyrion: If that's true,[p/] I believe that we should hear from Ms. Tudor directly.",
        "Tyrion: Let's hear how \"easily\" she gained access to the refinery on the day of the accident.",
        "Aria: We've already anticipated that.",

        "Aria: Then you'll have no problem answering the following question.",

        "Mosourika: S-[p/]Sorry, Tyrion...",

        "Aria: For the record,[p/] please testify in detail about how you entered the refinery that day, Ms. Tudor.",

        "Mosourika: I decided to look for him in the refinery's main building.",
        "Mosourika: There was some kind of magical door leading into it,[p/] but it was unlocked.",
        "Mosourika: Nothing really stopped me from entering the refinery building.",
        "Aria: As the court can clearly see,[p/] there were no safeguards preventing the witness from entering that restricted area.",
        "Tyrion: The witness clearly stated that there was a magical door leading into the building.",
        "Tyrion: This was obviously some sort of security door powered by artificery.",
        "Aria: ...Which was still unlocked and effectively useless.",
        "Damn it...[p/] There must be a way to prove that the unlocked door wasn't Dracogen's fault.",
        "Judge: 卡斯伯特先生，[p/]你可以开始交叉讯问了。",
        "Mosourika: That day,[p/] I was looking for Justin in the freight area.[p/] But I couldn't find him.",
        "Tyrion: You were there to deliver his dinner to him.[p/] Am I correct?",
        "Mosourika: Yeah...[p/] He was usually in the freight area around that time.",
        "Mosourika: I was surprised when I didn't see him there.",
        "Mosourika: I was a little worried so...",
        "Mosourika: I decided to look for him in the refinery's main building.",
        "Tyrion: It seems strange that you'd go looking for him.",
        "Tyrion: Why not just leave his food with one of his co-workers?",
        "Mosourika: I thought of that,[p/] but I also wanted to make sure that he was okay.",
        "Mosourika: I [i]was[/i] the one that helped him get this job in the first place.",
        "Mosourika: It wouldn't look good if he left in the middle of a shift.",
        "Aria: How [i]did[/i] you enter the Refinery Building, Ms. Tudor?",
        "Mosourika: There was some kind of magical door leading into it,[p/] but it was unlocked.",
        "Tyrion: By \"magical door\",[p/] do you mean that it was a door powered by artificery?",
        "Mosourika: Yeah...[p/] I have a door like it in my restaurant too.",
        "Mosourika: But this one looked a lot more complex.",
        "Tyrion: Why would you or Dracogen need magical doors, anyways?",
        "Mosourika: The one in my café magically locks the shop when I close it for the day.",
        "Mosourika: I guess the door to the refinery building was for the same thing.",
        "Tyrion: But that means that there [i]was[/i] a mechanism to keep out unauthorized personnel.",
        "Aria: ...Which was effectively useless.",
        "Aria: The witness entered the refinery and encountered zero resistance.",
        "Aria: Furthermore,[p/] the Inquisition has already logged the specs for the door.",
        "{0}",
        "Aria: Did you use a key to unlock the door, Ms. Tudor?",
        "Mosourika: No...[p/] I didn't...",
        "Aria: As you can see from this report,[p/] Stefanic Dracogen was the only person capable of disabling the lock.",
        "Mosourika: I guess Mr. Dracogen kept the door unlocked during work hours...",
        "Aria: This means that it's entirely Dracogen's fault that the victim gained access to the building in the first place.",
        "Mosourika: W-[p/][s/]Wait![p/][s/] That's not what I meant to-!",
        "Aria: But that [i]is[/i] what you implied.",
        "Aria: Unless you can prove that [i]another[/i] person disabled that door.",
        "Tyrion: ...",
        "You can't refute that statement...[p/] yet.",
        "But you might be able to work with this new information.",
        "Tyrion: Regardless,[p/] please add that last statement to your testimony, witness.",
        "Mosourika: Alright...",
        "Mosourika: Mr. Dracogen must have disabled the lock.[p/] No one else could have disabled it.",
        "Tyrion: That's quite the leap in logic.",
        "Aria: The specs of the door state that the lock can only be disabled by Stefanic Dracogen.",
        "Mosourika: Sorry,[p/] but I can't think of any other reason why it would be disabled.",
        "Mosourika: I mean...[p/] I get it.",
        "Mosourika: Sometimes I forget the key to my shop.[p/] It becomes a real headache when I get locked out.",
        "You suppose that makes sense.[p/] But would Dracogen really do something like that?",
        "The lock is [i]designed[/i] to be disabled only by Dracogen.",
        "But perhaps someone did something to bypass that.",
        "Mosourika: Nothing really stopped me from entering the refinery building.",
        "Tyrion: Are you sure you're not forgetting any obstacles that you encountered?",
        "Mosourika: No...[p/] I would have remembered something like that.",
        "Mosourika: If someone told me that I wasn't supposed to be there,[p/] I would've just left.",

        "Celeste: Maybe the employees got lazy and disabled the lock against his orders...",

        "Aria: That's correct.",

        "Aria: But what does [i]this[/i] have to do with the disabled magical lock?",
        "Tyrion: Ms. Steelwind.[p/] Justin owned a set of tools that he used for picking mundane [i]and[/i] magical locks.",
        "Tyrion: The safe that he was planning to rob was located in my client's office within the Refinery Building.",
        "Tyrion: I have witnesses who [i]saw[/i] Justin retrieve those tools shortly before the night of the accident.",
        "Tyrion: He clearly had a plan to disable any locks that stood between him and that safe.",
        "Tyrion: This means that it's entirely possible that [i]Justin[/i] disabled the locked Refinery Door illegally.",

        "Aria: \"[b]Transmutation[/b] magic.",
        "Aria: As in...[p/] magic that could be used to weaken and sabotage parts of the refinery.",
        "Judge: No...[p/] Are you seriously accusing...",
        "Tyrion: Your Honor![p/][s/] Lloyd von Sanctus sent a Construct into the Arcane Refinery to sabotage it!",

        "Lloyd: The defense's theory is laughable.[p/] And I have several pieces of evidence that can easily prove my innocence.",
        "He has a good poker face.[p/] But the Eye is telling you that he's a little desperate.",
        "Judge: V-[p/]Very well.[p/] If the defense wishes to accuse you,[p/] I see no harm in allowing you to defend yourself.",
        "Judge: The court would very much like to hear your testimony on the matter.",

        "Lloyd: Therefore,[p/] I had no way of observing this Construct from afar.[p/] Nor did I have any way to communicate with it.",
        "That...[p/] actually makes a lot of sense.",

        "How did he account for the Constructs' error-prone logic?",
        "Lloyd: It [i]is[/i] possible to order a Construct to complete a complex list of tasks.[p/] But doing so is ill-advised.",
        "Tyrion: Is that not a massive flaw in the Construct's design?",
        "Lloyd: Artificery can only do so much.",
        "Lloyd: It's difficult enough to create magical items that respond to verbal commands.",
        "Lloyd: But our magic is still not advanced enough to replicate the common sense of a living creature.",
        "Lloyd: The Arcane Construct is still a marvelous invention.",
        "Lloyd: You merely need to supervise them if you give them complex tasks.",
        "Tyrion: But regardless,[p/] you admitted that it [i]is[/i] possible.",
        "Lloyd: Yes,[p/] but...",
        "Lloyd: I'm sure you observed this with the Nightgrave trial.[p/] Constructs are extremely prone to error when completing a long list of tasks.",
        "Tyrion: Are you referring to what happened with Theodore Redmond's Construct?",
        "Lloyd: I am.",
        "Lloyd: It goes without saying that the Constructs weren't designed to aid and abet murder.",
        "Lloyd: But they also weren't designed to carry out such a long list of tasks unsupervised.",
        "Lloyd: A lot of Redmond's orders fell well outside of the Construct's intended usage.",
        "Lloyd: He ordered it to transport a human body from one point to another.",
        "Lloyd: And he even ordered it to play audio to make itself look like a person.",
        "Lloyd: I'm sure you know how that ended.",
        "He's right.[p/] The Construct encountered unforeseen circumstances and failed to complete its tasks...",
        "But as the Constructs' creator,[p/] von Sanctus knew that such circumstances would be unavoidable...",
        "So how did he get around that?",
        "Lloyd: According to the defense,[p/] the saboteur stole a Rod of Mending and used it to sabotage very [i]specific[/i] sections of the refinery.",
        "Tyrion: That's correct.",
        "Tyrion: As the chairman of Von Sanctus Industries,[p/] you would have the resources and know-how to use it in such a way.",
        "Lloyd: Yes.[p/] I suppose I would.",
        "Lloyd: But you forget that I couldn't have been there personally.",
        "Lloyd: I would never trust a Construct to discreetly complete such an intricate set of tasks unsupervised.",
        "Tyrion: Perhaps you were desperate enough to take a chance like that.",
        "Lloyd: Please.[p/] I'll admit that I find Dracogen to be a nuisance to my holdings.",
        "Lloyd: But I was hardly in a position to resort to such desperate tactics.",

        "If Celeste hadn't cast [b]Detect Magic[/b],[p/] no one would have ever known that someone used magic within the refinery.",
        "Lloyd: And before you ask,[p/] I was miles away from the refinery at the time of the accident.[p/] I have several associates who can confirm this alibi.",
        "Tyrion: And I suppose you wouldn't mind having these \"associates\" testify before the court.",

        "Tyrion: If that's true,[p/] then how could you have [i]possibly[/i] seen Justin fall off of the walkway again afterward?!",
        "Noah: I-[p/]I have no idea...",
        "Aria: Mr. Cuthbert,[p/] you're disputing the witness' testimony over a [i]minor[/i] detail.",
        "Aria: It's entirely possible that Mr. Morrison [i]or[/i] Ms. Tudor simply misremembered.",
        "Tyrion: I highly doubt that Morrison misremembered the order of what happened.",
        "Tyrion: His testimony matches up [i]exactly[/i] with the testimony of his companion.",
        "Aria: Then [i]Ms. Tudor[/i] must be the one who's mistaken.",
        "Judge: I'm compelled to agree with Ms. Steelwind.",
        "Judge: These conflicting accounts seem extremely minor.",
        "Tyrion: The prosecution's case is based on the broken guard rail.",
        "Tyrion: And only three individuals [i]witnessed[/i] Justin Waye break said guard rail.",
        "Tyrion: The defense asserts that these three witness accounts [i]must[/i] be consistent with each other.",
        "Tyrion: Otherwise,[p/] this evidence is [i]not[/i] strong enough to find my client liable.",
        "Aria: Please.[p/] The break in the guard rail is [i]directly[/i] over the vat.",
        "Aria: [i]That[/i] is enough physical evidence.[p/] It proves that the victim fell in because the railing broke.",
        "Tyrion: How do we know that the guard rail wasn't broken by some other event?",
        "Aria: That's ludicrous![p/][s/] You're clearly just playing devil's advocate!",
        "Judge: I'll admit that I also find the defense's assertion...[p/] dubious.",
        "Judge: However,[p/] I see no harm in allowing Ms. Tudor to testify to what she saw.",
        "Aria: ...",
        "Rika saw a lot less than Morrison and Aster did.[p/] [i]And[/i] her testimony was a lot less detailed.",
        "But the one detail she [i]did[/i] remember was that she saw Justin fall off of the walkway.",
        "Hopefully,[p/] her testimony might clear up what happened.",
        "Judge: Bailiff,[p/] please escort Ms. Tudor to the witness stand.",
        "Aria: Witness,[p/] please state your name and occupation for the courtroom.",
        "Hm...[p/] This is probably Rika's first time testifying in a courtroom.",
        "You hope she'll be okay...",
        "Mosourika: As if I need such introductions...[p/][s/] But allow me to indulge you all!",
        "Oh Lord,[p/][s/] is she seriously doing that [i]here[/i]?!",
        "Mosourika: [i]I[/i] am Mosourika Tudor:[p/][s/] Dark Lord of Aurinax,[p/][s/] High Archmagi of the Cadmium Flames,[p/][s/] and business proprietor of sweet confections!",
        "Judge: I-[p/][s/]I see![p/][s/] I was not aware we were in the presence of such a renowned individual.",
        "Wait...[p/][s/] Does he actually believe her?!",
        "Tyrion: Your Honor,[p/] Mosourika Tudor is the owner of a local café in Aurinax.",

        "You would say that [i]your[/i] \"flow\" is the most disrupted right now...",
        "Tyrion: *Ahem*[p/] [i]Anyways[/i], Ms. Tudor,[p/] you were at the Aurinax Refinery on the night of the accident.",
        "Tyrion: And you witnessed the moment that the victim fell off of the walkway.[p/] Am I correct?",
        "Mosourika: Y-[p/]Yes.[p/] That's right.",
        "Tyrion: According to your statement,[p/] you ran up to Morrison [i]after[/i] you saw Justin fall off of the walkway.",
        "Tyrion: The problem is that there's a contradiction between both of your testimonies.",
        "Mosourika: T-[p/]There's a \"contradiction\"?!",
        "Tyrion: Morrison testified that he didn't see the victim fall into the vat until [i]after[/i] you approached him.",
        "Tyrion: This wouldn't make sense, though.",
        "Tyrion: You saw the victim fall off of the walkway before you ran up to Morrison.",
        "Tyrion: Morrison couldn't have possibly seen the victim fall again [i]after[/i] that.",
        "Mosourika: ...",
        "Mosourika: Oh...[p/] I think I see what happened.",
        "Tyrion: You do?",
        "Mosourika: I think you're misunderstanding what I said before.",
        "Tyrion: ...I misunderstood you?",
        "Tyrion: If that's true,[p/] could you please testify to the court exactly what happened?",
        "Tyrion: Please include every detail you can remember.",
        "Mosourika: Sure...",
        "Mosourika: I was at the refinery when I heard a strange sound from the walkway.",
        "Mosourika: When I looked to see what it was,[p/] I saw that Justin had tumbled over the guard rail.",
        "Mosourika: But he hadn't fallen into the vat yet.[p/] I saw him barely hanging onto the edge of the platform.",
        "Mosourika: I didn't know how to get to the walkway from there.[p/] So I looked for help on the grounds and found Mr. Morrison.",
        "Mosourika: He must have seen Justin lose his grip of the ledge and fall into the vat after that.",
        "Judge: So the victim didn't immediately fall into the vat.[p/] He was hanging onto the edge of the walkway.",
        "Judge: That [i]would[/i] explain how Mr. Morrison saw the victim fall into the vat after Ms. Tudor saw him fall off of the walkway.",
        "Aria: ...",
        "Judge: In any case, Mr. Cuthbert,[p/] you may begin your cross-examination.",
        "Mosourika: I was at the refinery when I heard a strange sound from the walkway.",
        "Tyrion: What kind of sound did you hear?",
        "Mosourika: I'm not quite sure.",
        "Mosourika: If I had to guess,[p/] I'd say that it sounded like the sound of metal hitting metal.",
        "\"Metal hitting metal\"?",
        "The refinery walkway [i]is[/i] made out of metal.",
        "So perhaps the sound she heard was something metallic colliding with the walkway.",
        "Did something shake the walkway and make Justin lose his balance?",
        "Mosourika: When I looked to see what it was,[p/] I saw that Justin had tumbled over the walkway's guard rail.",
        "Tyrion: So [i]this[/i] was the moment that you saw Justin fall off of the walkway.",
        "Mosourika: Yeah...",
        "Tyrion: And you said that he fell [i]over[/i] the guard rail?",
        "Mosourika: I did...[p/] But I'm not sure how it happened.[p/] I think something caused him to lose his balance.",
        "Mosourika: He tumbled over the guard rail and fell right off of the walkway.",
        "Interesting...",
        "Tyrion: But that still doesn't explain why Morrison saw him fall [i]after[/i] you ran to him for help.",
        "Mosourika: Well, I [i]did[/i] see Justin fall from the walkway...",
        "Mosourika: But he hadn't fallen into the vat yet.[p/] I saw him barely hanging onto the edge of the platform.",
        "Tyrion: He was hanging onto the ledge?",

        "Mosourika: I didn't know how to get to the walkway from there.[p/] So I looked around for help and found Mr. Morrison.",
        "Tyrion: And did you see another individual with him?",
        "Mosourika: Yeah...[p/] I did.",
        "Mosourika: I tried to explain to him and his friend what was going on.",
        "Mosourika: But they couldn't hear me over the machines.",
        "Hm...[p/] That [i]does[/i] match with the testimonies that he and Aster gave you.",

        "Tyrion: Did you also see this moment?",
        "Mosourika: No. [p/] I didn't.",
        "Mosourika: I was so busy trying to talk to Mr. Morrison that I didn't see it.",

        "Noah: Mosourika came running towards us.[p/] She was trying to tell us something.[p/] But the damn machines were too loud for us to hear her.",
        "Noah: She pointed at the walkway.[p/] And that's when we saw someone fall into the vat.",
        "Noah: By the time we could get them to stop the machines.[p/] It was too late.",
        "And then there's Aster's account of events.",
        "Tyrion: Did you see the expression on his face?[p/] He might have been unconscious.",

        "Could Justin have survived the accident?",
        "No...[p/] He was drenched in several corrosive and volatile chemicals.",

        "Another person...?[p/][s/] Is that really possible?!",
