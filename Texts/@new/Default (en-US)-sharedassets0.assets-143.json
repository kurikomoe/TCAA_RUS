        "The murderer couldn't have dragged her body there in such a short amount of time.",

        "Orym: And he stands at the top of the religious hierarchy from what I hear.",

        "Tyrion: The murderer killed von Sanctus,[p/] Sibyl,[p/] and Pierce.[p/] In that order.",

        "But there's clearly a more direct path they could have taken if they wanted to murder the three victims quickly.",
        "Tyrion: The murderer must have passed right by the Prayer Room before they dumped Sibyl's body.",
        "Tyrion: Why wouldn't they just murder Pierce on the way there?",
        "Orym: Maybe they wanted to dump Sibyl's body first.",
        "Celeste: ...Or they were afraid of fighting me.",
        "Orym: ...Aren't you giving yourself a little too much credit?",
        "Tyrion: No.[p/] She has a point.",
        "Tyrion: Out of everyone who fought the murderer,[p/] Celeste was the only one who didn't die or fall comatose.",

        "Tyrion: But Lord Steelwind's directions were pretty straightforward...[p/] So why are we-...?",
        "Tyrion: Wait a minute...",
        "Celeste: ...Did he give us the wrong location on [i]purpose[/i]?!",
        "Lucio: Please.[p/] What kind of dishonorable cretin do you take me for?",
        "Tyrion: Lord Steelwind.",
        "Lucio: What are you two standing around here for?[p/] The trial will be starting shortly.",
        "He's not alone either.[p/] He's flanked by a division of the Kingsguard and Aria.",
        "But it's difficult to tell if they're escorting her or keeping watch over her.",
        "You can see one of the knights channeling a spell over Aria.",
        "It must be an [b]Anti-Magic Field[/b].",
        "Even now,[p/] she must still be wary about someone taking control of her mind.",
        "Tyrion: Wait...[p/] [i]This[/i] is where we'll be hosting the trial?",
        "Lucio: Yes.[p/] The \"archduke\" has always been sentimental about this place.",
        "Lucio: And I doubt a normal courtroom would have enough...[p/] space.",
        "Tyrion: ...What?",
        "Lucio: I really don't know [i]what[/i] possessed him to trust you.",

        "Tyrion: Alright...[p/] I guess we're doing this.",
        "The ruins are filled with everyone who was at the Grand Cathedral that day.",
        "And they all seem to be just as out of the loop as you are.",
        "The only person who seems to be unfazed by this entire situation is Lord Steelwind.",

        "Lucio: There will be no going back after this.",
        "Tyrion: ...What?",
        "Remus: I've made many mistakes in my lifetime...",
        "Remus: I gave Wyverngarde the means to protect themselves.[p/] But all it did was warp them into something monstrous.",
        "Remus: I grew bitter seeing what I'd created...[p/] So I isolated myself from my people.",
        "Remus: I thought my best course of action would be to stay in seclusion and leave Wyverngarde to fend for themselves.",
        "Remus: ...I see now what a fool I was.",
        "Remus: I abandoned my kin to survive in an unjust world.",

        "Rath: But make no mistake...[p/] Even in my human form,[p/] I have [i]always[/i] had the strength of an ancient dragon.",
        "Rath: Until now,[p/] only the Lords of House Steelwind and the Kings of Wyverngarde have known my true identity.",

        "Rath: But for the sake of doing this properly,[p/] could you please list the charges, Lucio?",
        "Lucio: ...Of course.",
        "Lucio: The defendant:[p/] Aria Steelwind,[p/] is charged with several counts of manslaughter.",
        "Lucio: Her victims include many knights from the Kingsguard who are still unresponsive.",
        "Lucio: And of course,[p/] there's Lloyd von Sanctus and Coraline Sibyl:[p/] the heads of House von Sanctus and House Sibyl respectively.",

        "Tyrion: ...Might I remind the court of my [i]own[/i] testimony?",
        "Tyrion: I [i]witnessed[/i] Beatrice Frega enter the Prayer Room before I lost consciousness.",
        "Tyrion: Isn't it suspicious that this occurred around fifteen minutes [i]before[/i] Pierce's death?",
        "Lucio: If I recall correctly,[p/] you only caught a glimpse of her.",
        "Lucio: You don't know if it was someone [i]else[/i] disguised in an illusion.",
        "Lucio: You didn't even speak to her.",
        "Tyrion: That's all the more reason to call her to the stand to explain herself.",
        "Lucio: She has already testified that she has no memories of what transpired during the massacre.",
        "Lucio:  ...There is no need to drag this out any longer than necessary, Cuthbert!",
        "Tyrion: My client [i]has[/i] a right to a fair trial!",
        "Tyrion: And Beatrice Frega's involvement clearly implies [i]some[/i] sort of foul play!",
        "Rath: Enough.[p/] I find Mr. Cuthbert's request to be reasonable.",
        "Rath: And I agree that Lady Frega's actions are quite suspect.",
        "Lucio: Hmph...",
        "Lucio: Very well.[p/] Let the defense have his battle.",

        "She actually looks pretty sincere.[p/] But it's not as if this is the first time she's lied to you.",
        "Tyrion: To be honest,[p/] I'm still a little doubtful about your \"memory loss\".",
        "MBeatrice: But I'm not the only one who experienced it.",
        "MBeatrice: Aria [i]also[/i] has no memories of what happened.",
        "Lucio: ...And how would you know that?",
        "MBeatrice: ...Word travels around quickly in the dungeons.",
        "Lucio: ...What?",
        "Tyrion: Regardless.[p/] If you truly have no memories of what happened,[p/] could you testify about what you [i]do[/i] remember?",
        "Tyrion: Perhaps there's a clue there we haven't discovered yet.",
        "MBeatrice: ...Very well.",
        "MBeatrice: I was with my sisters and my...[p/] guide,[p/] Eris Illmater.",

        "MBeatrice: When I woke up,[p/] my sisters found me.[p/] They said that I had gone missing for over an hour.",
        "MBeatrice: I was confused.[p/] But when I later heard what happened,[p/] I realized that someone must have taken control of my body.",
        "MBeatrice: I have no memories of what happened.[p/] And from what I understand,[p/] the same thing happened to Aria.",
        "MBeatrice: And to make matters worse,[p/] there's [i]nothing[/i] that indicates who may have controlled our actions.",
        "So she's [i]also[/i] saying that someone else was controlling her...",
        "Well...[p/] Her testimony [i]does[/i] match up with Aria's statement.",
        "But there's something [i]off[/i] about the way she's testifying.",
        "If she were trying to lie to you,[p/] she would have been a lot more vague.",
        "...What is she doing?",
        "MBeatrice: I was with my sisters and my...[p/] guide,[p/] Eris Illmater.",
        "Tyrion: ...She's been missing since the massacre happened.",
        "Tyrion: I really hope she's okay.",
        "MBeatrice: Oh, make no mistake.",
        "MBeatrice: She's [i]definitely[/i] okay.",
        "Tyrion: ...What makes you so sure?",
        "Tyrion: Do you remember [i]anything[/i] about what happened to her?",
        "MBeatrice: ...No.[p/] But it's just a feeling.",
        "Lucio: Enough of your speculation.",
        "Lucio: Tell us what happened next, Frega.",
        "MBeatrice: I was speaking with them in the garden,[p/] when I suddenly felt ill and lost consciousness.",
        "Tyrion: If they were with you,[p/] shouldn't your sisters have noticed this?",
        "Lucio: According to Laefe and Miriam,[p/] their pet dog was running amok in the hallways.",
        "Lucio: They left the witness with Illmater to chase him down.",
        "Lucio: And when the sisters returned to the garden,[p/] both Beatrice and Illmater were gone.",
        "MBeatrice: ...",
        "Tyrion: Do you remember [i]anything[/i] after that?",
        "MBeatrice: I",
        "MBeatrice: No...[p/] I really [i]want[/i] to remember,[p/] but I can't.",

        "MBeatrice: I was confused.[p/] But when I later heard what happened,[p/] I realized that someone must have taken control of my body.",
        "Tyrion: So you're [i]also[/i] saying that someone else controlled your body?",
        "MBeatrice: Yes.[p/] It's the only explanation for why you saw me in the Prayer Room.",
        "Lucio: Absolutely ridiculous!",
        "Lucio: Arcane magic is [i]not[/i] capable of mind control!",
        "Lucio: You're spinning a fairy tale to absolve yourself!",
        "You're compelled to agree with him.",
        "...So why do you feel like something's wrong?",

        "She looks extremely frustrated for some reason...",
        "Player: Overflow",
        "The way she's testifying is a little bit strange.",
        "She immediately concluded that someone had taken control of her.",

        "Player: Default",
        "Tyrion: Your Grace![p/][s/] It's clear that the witness's testimony is contradictory!",

        "Tyrion: ...Beatrice,[p/] you said there's no indication of who orchestrated this.",
        "Tyrion: But there is [i]one[/i] piece of evidence that does just that,[p/] albeit loosely.",

        "You pull out the parchment with the Purple Mark on it and show it to her.",

        "Tyrion: You see, Beatrice,[p/] Aria has been investigating a string of murders throughout Wyverngarde.",
        "Tyrion: These murders [i]appear[/i] to be unrelated,[p/] despite how gruesome they are.",
        "Tyrion: But they all share one thing in common.",
        "Tyrion: [i]This[/i] symbol was found at each and every crime scene.",
        "Lucio: Don't tell me my daughter has roped you into her little conspiracy theory...",
        "Lucio: Your \"mind control\" defense would be laughable if it weren't downright insulting.",
        "Tyrion: Lord Steelwind.[p/][s/] During the gap in Aria's memory,[p/] someone [i]placed[/i] this mark in her pocket!",
        "Tyrion: It was clearly some sort of taunt from whoever orchestrated this.",
        "Lucio: Nonsense![p/] She clearly drew that symbol [i]herself[/i] during her psychotic episode!",
        "Lucio: I've had to listen to her go on and on about her insane theory!",
        "Lucio: She was obsessed with it!",
        "MBeatrice: ...Mr. Cuthbert.[p/] Aren't you curious about what just happened?",
        "Tyrion: ...What are you talking about?",
        "MBeatrice: Think about it.[p/] Why did",
        "MBeatrice: My apologies.[p/] I don't know why I said that.",

        "MBeatrice: Yes...[p/] I'm [i]perfectly[/i] fine.",
        "MBeatrice: Anyways,[p/] it looks like you'll have to figure the rest out on your own.",
        "Tyrion: \"Figure out the rest on my own\"...?",

        "Lucio: There's nothing [i]to[/i] figure out!",
        "Lucio: Your Grace![p/][s/] These two are making a mockery of us by spouting these [i]insane[/i] theories!",

        "Player: Fail",
        "No...[p/] There's a common thread here.",
        "First,[p/] Beatrice seems to know about the Purple Mark that Aria has been investigating.",
        "Second,[p/] Marrunath is [i]preventing[/i] Beatrice from seeing what it is.",
        "He's a demon who [i]shouldn't[/i] personally care about the politics of Wyverngarde.",
        "The Purple Mark must be related to a demon somehow.",
        "That's the only explanation as to why he would prevent her from seeing the Mark...",
        "But Aria has been investigating murders [i]throughout[/i] Wyverngarde.",
        "Does this mean that her investigation [i]also[/i] has something to do with a demon?",
        "...Aria suspected that each of the murderers was acting against their will.",
        "And now both Aria and Beatrice are [i]also[/i] claiming they were controlled.",

        "It said what would happen if she failed to claim House Frega.",
        "\"Her soul,[p/] her [i]mind[/i],[p/] and her life would all be claimed by the Empress of Discord.\"",
        "If this \"Empress of Discord\" owns Beatrice's \"mind\",[p/] would that mean they could also control Beatrice against her will?",
        "But if that were true...",
        "Player: Aria lost control of their mind due to a Blood Contract",
        "Player: Fail",
        "No...[p/] You might finally have an explanation for how Beatrice may have been controlled against her will.",
        "But if you follow that logic...[p/] It reveals a grim conclusion for Aria.",
        "No...[p/] That can't be right, can it?",
        "Did Aria seriously sign a Blood Contract with a demon?",
        "But why would she [i]ever[/i] do that...?",
        "...But it's the conclusion that makes the most sense.",
        "You can't think of any [i]other[/i] way someone could control her against her will.",
        "...And there [i]is[/i] one way to find out for certain.",
        "The Divine Edict.[p/] That same ability you used against Beatrice during [i]her[/i] trial.",
        "It was instinctual at the time...[p/] But you have some understanding of how it works.",
        "It creates a copy of a Blood Contract between a contract holder and the demon who created it.",
        "But for it to work,[p/] you need to know the name of the contract holder.",
        "In addition to that,[p/] you need the name of the demon who created the contract.",
        "Right now,[p/] you're only relying on guesswork.",
        "But going off of what you know,[p/] the demon who made the contract must be...",
        "Player: The Empress of Discord",
        "Player: Marrunath",
        "No...[p/] Marrunath is constantly around Beatrice.",
        "Whoever made this contract with Aria probably made contracts with each of the murderers in this conspiracy.",
        "The Purple Mark must be some sort of symbol of that demon.",
        "...And going off of what you've deduced so far,[p/] Beatrice would recognize that mark.",
        "Player: Eugene Haroldson",
        "What...?[p/] Why would you even-?",
        "...Are you feeling okay?",
        "As far as you know,[p/] Eugene the monkey is [i]not[/i] a demon.",
        "There's a far more reasonable guess.",
        "Player: An unknown demon",
        "There's apparently an entire hellish plane [i]filled[/i] with demons.",
        "So it's possible that the demon involved is one you've never heard of before.",
        "But even so,[p/] there's no harm in taking a guess.",
        "The so-called \"Empress of Discord\"...",
        "She was mentioned in Beatrice's Blood Contract.[p/] But you still have no idea who or [i]what[/i] she is.",
        "However,[p/] she was mentioned in a Blood Contract created by Marrunath.",
        "She must be his superior in some way.",
        "That [i]might[/i] explain why Marrunath doesn't want Beatrice to identify the Purple Mark.",
        "You're not sure if a pseudonym is enough.[p/] But it's the closest you can get with what you know so far.",
        "Rath: ...You've been awfully quiet for a while, Mr. Cuthbert.",
        "Rath: What are you thinking about?",
        "Lucio: He's probably imagining [i]new[/i] ways to futilely stall for time.",
        "Tyrion: I think...[p/] I've finally figured out [i]why[/i] the witness and the defendant can't remember anything.",
        "Tyrion: And it would also explain why they didn't have control of their actions.",
        "Lucio: Hmph...[p/] Again with this?",
        "Lucio: If you're so convinced of my daughter's conspiracy,[p/] why don't you prove it?!",
        "Tyrion: I...",
        "Lucio: Hmph...[p/][s/] I knew it!",
        "Lucio: Even [i]you[/i] don't believe in the nonsense you're spouting.",
        "Tyrion: Lord Steelwind...[p/] I want to be wrong about this...",
        "Tyrion: ...If I'm right,[p/] the implications don't bode well for [i]anyone[/i] involved.",
        "Tyrion: So instead of [i]telling[/i] you,[p/] I think it would be better to show you.",

        "MBeatrice: Damn it...",
        "MBeatrice: I knew you could do it.",
        "Tyrion: By the Eye of Horus,[p/][s/] I issue upon you a divine edict!",
        "Tyrion: Release thy guards and manifest your Blood Contract with Aria Steelwind!",
        "{0}",
        "Rath: No...",
        "Rath: This [i]can't[/i] be true...",
        "Lucio: This is...",
        "Rath: Enough![p/][s/] Stop prattling amongst yourself!",
        "Rath: ...",
        "Lucio: No![p/][s/] This is a sham!",
        "Lucio: This [i]wretch[/i] has clearly created a convincing fabrication!",
        "Rath: ...It's genuine, Lucio.[p/]",
        "Rath: It's impossible to falsify something like this.",
        "Tyrion: You can't deny the truth anymore, Lord Steelwind.",
        "Tyrion: There [i]is[/i] a way to control someone else's actions.",
        "Tyrion: Aria Steelwind wasn't affected by Mageblight!",
        "Tyrion: She was controlled against her will!",
        "Lucio: ...",
        "Rath: ...With this evidence,[p/] there's no doubt that Aria [i]did[/i] sign a Blood Contract.",
        "Rath: But it still doesn't make sense.",
        "Tyrion: I agree...",
        "Tyrion: Even [i]if[/i] Aria was the type of person to sign a Contract with a demon...",
        "Tyrion: There isn't a single part of this contract that benefits her.",
        "Player: Aria signed the contract because it looked like a normal document",
        "Player: Fail",
        "No...[p/] Aria would never make a contract with a demon willingly.",
        "And even if she did,[p/] [i]no one[/i] would ever agree to terms like this.",
        "There's only one explanation for why she would sign this.",
        "Tyrion: There's a large empty space above the terms of your daughter's contract.",
        "Tyrion: When I issue a Divine Edict,[p/] it creates a copy of the Blood Contract that I call for.",
        "Tyrion: I think when she was given this contract,[p/] it probably looked like something entirely different.",
        "Tyrion: Something [i]else[/i] was written in this empty space to make it look like a normal legal document.",
        "Tyrion: Which means that my client was [i]not[/i] in control of her actions that day!",
        "Lucio: Enough of this![p/][s/] [i]All[/i] of you!",
        "Tyrion: Do you see now, Lord Steelwind?",
        "Tyrion: Aria was not responsible for what happened.",
        "Lucio: ...",
        "Lucio: [i]That[/i] remains to be proven.",
        "Tyrion: What are you [i]talking[/i] about?!",
        "Tyrion: She has a Blood Contract that relinquishes control of her free will!",
        "Lucio: Not having control and not being responsible are two [i]very[/i] different things, Cuthbert.",
        "Tyrion: What?!",
        "Lucio: I'll admit...[p/] The defendant may not have had control of her actions when she murdered the victims.",
        "Lucio: ...[i]However[/i], she [i]did[/i] have full control of herself when she [i]signed[/i] this Contract.",
        "Tyrion: Are you serious?!",
        "Tyrion: No one in their right mind would [i]willingly[/i] sign a Contract like this!",
        "Lucio: ...And what of Beatrice Frega?",
        "Lucio: Was [i]she[/i] in her right mind when she made a Contract with the demon Marrunath?",
        "Tyrion: I-[p/][s/]I...",
        "Lucio: If we can't hold the defendant responsible,[p/] [i]surely[/i] we should also acquit Lady Frega for the murder of her father?",
        "Tyrion: T-[p/][s/]That's [i]hardly[/i] the same thing!",
        "Lucio: [i]I[/i], for one, fail to see the difference.",
        "Lucio: A fool made a deal with a demon.[p/] And as a result several esteemed members of the nobility were killed.",
        "Tyrion: She's your [i]daughter[/i], Lucio!",
        "Lucio: And how does [i]that[/i] change anything?!",
        "Damn it...[p/] He seriously doesn't care if he convicts Aria...",
        "Lucio: Honestly...[p/] This only places [i]more[/i] responsibility on her for what happened.",
        "Lucio: I could have [i]accepted[/i] if she had been reckless and [i]accidentally[/i] induced Mageblight.",
        "Lucio: But to sign a Contract with a [i]demon[/i]?!",
        "Lucio: That only further espouses the need to [i]put her down[/i]!",
        "Tyrion: She was clearly [i]tricked[/i], Lucio!",
        "Lucio: Is that so?!",
        "Lucio: As a [i]fellow[/i] attorney,[p/] would you really sign a Contract without [i]carefully[/i] inspecting it?!",
        "Tyrion: I-[p/][s/]I...",
        "Lucio: Whether it was through foolishness,[p/] negligence,[p/] or both.",
        "Lucio: The defendant willingly signed a Blood Contract.",
        "Lucio: She compromised herself.[p/] And as a result,[p/] three nobles died.",
        "Lucio: The responsibility falls [i]squarely[/i] on her.",
        "Wait...",
        "Even if she willingly signed that Contract,[p/] that's not entirely true, is it?",
        "Player: The Patron",
        "Player: Fail",
        "No...[p/] You can't really disprove what he's saying,[p/] even if it's completely outrageous.",
        "Objectively,[p/] you can't prove that Aria didn't willingly sign that Contract.",
        "But even if you admit that,[p/] there's [i]someone[/i] else involved that was clearly acting with malice.",
        "Tyrion: Lucio![p/][s/] There's clearly someone else to blame for Aria's actions that day.",
        "Lucio: Oh?[p/] And who would that be?",
        "Tyrion: I'd like to reread my client's Blood Contract to the court.",
        "Tyrion: \"By signing this contract, Aria Steelwind surrenders her mind, body, and soul to the Patron.\"",
        "Tyrion: [i]That[/i] can only mean one thing!",
        "Tyrion: Whoever this Patron is,[p/][s/] [i]they[/i] took control of my client and [i]used[/i] her to murder the victims!",
        "Gallery: T-[p/][s/]That's right!",
        "Gallery: They could still be out there!",
        "Gallery: None of us are safe until this \"Patron\" is apprehended!",
        "Tyrion: [i]Surely[/i] we can't end this trial while every member of the Wyverngarde nobility is in danger.",
        "Lucio: Hmph...",
        "Lucio: Well played.",
        "Rath: I'm compelled to agree with Mr. Cuthbert.",
        "Rath: Trickery or not,[p/] it's clear [i]someone[/i] wished ill intent on the nobles.",
        "Tyrion: ...And until we know [i]who[/i] this Patron is,[p/] you can't pass judgment on my client.",
        "Tyrion: Not until we know the circumstances that she signed that Blood Contract under.",
        "Lucio: ...And what would [i]you[/i] have us do, Cuthbert?",
        "Lucio: The Contract has no stipulations about proximity or [i]how[/i] this mind control works.",
        "Lucio: For all we know,[p/] this \"Patron\" could have murdered the victims all while sitting in their very home.",
        "Tyrion: There was a clear intent behind this attack.",
        "Tyrion: Even [i]if[/i] the Patron didn't directly participate in the murders,[p/] they definitely had a motive.",
        "Tyrion: If Aria was being controlled,[p/] then we can analyze her behavior to determine [i]who[/i] was controlling her.",
        "Rath: I see...[p/] That does sound as good a plan as any.",
        "Rath: At the very least,[p/] we can't allow this Patron to escape justice.",
        "Lucio: ...",
        "Rath: Despite the questions raised,[p/] we've clearly made some headway.",
        "Rath: I believe we should take a brief \"recess\" to process these revelations.",
        "Lucio: Hmph...[p/] Very well...",
        "You step outside the Scaled Lord's lair to get some fresh air.",
        "...These new revelations are a lot to take in.",
        "Celeste: ...",
        "Celeste looks especially down.",
        "From what you've observed,[p/] she and Aria have been speaking to each other a lot.",
        "They must have become friends over the many times they've met.",
        "You can't imagine how powerless she feels right now.",
        "Aria: ...",
        "Celeste: Aria...[p/] I...",
        "Celeste: I'm so sorry...",
        "Aria: ...Don't be.[p/] I...",
        "Her voice begins to break.",
        "She's always been stoic.[p/] But it's clear even [i]she[/i] has her breaking point.",
        "Tyrion: I can't imagine what you're feeling right now.",
        "Tyrion: ...But there's still hope.",
        "Tyrion: If we can find out who did this to you,[p/] we can still save you.",
        "Aria: ...",
        "Tyrion: Do you remember if you've signed [i]anything[/i] recently?",
        "Aria: N-[p/][s/]No.[p/] I don't...",
        "Tyrion: Damn it...[p/] The Patron must've wiped your memories to cover their tracks.",
        "Aria: But I still don't understand.",
        "Aria: Even if I [i]don't[/i] remember signing that contract,[p/] I don't think I would be that careless.",
        "Tyrion: Right...[p/] As much as I hate to admit it,[p/] Lucio was right.",
        "Tyrion: You're an attorney like me.[p/] And we always carefully look over contracts before we sign them.",
        "Tyrion: Which raises the question of [i]how[/i] the Patron got your signature.",
        "Aria: I don't know...",
        "Aria: I just...",
        "Aria: ...",
        "Tyrion: Damn it...[p/] We don't even know what circumstances you were under when you signed that contract.",
        "Tyrion: For all we know,[p/] the Patron could have used any number of tactics to coerce you into doing this.",
        "Aria: That's...[p/] also possible.",
        "Celeste: ...Aria.",
        "As you're deliberating amongst yourselves,[p/] Lord Steelwind approaches you.",
        "Celeste: ...What are [i]you[/i] doing here?",
        "Aria: ...Father.",
        "Lucio: ...",
        "Lucio: Hmph...",
        "Celeste: I can't believe him!",
        "Celeste: How does he have nothing to say?!",
        "Aria: ...",
        "His actions say otherwise...[p/][s/] But you could've sworn you saw something through the Eye.",
        "It's almost as if he was...[p/] saddened and worried.",
        "...",
        "...Well,[p/] no matter how he feels internally,[p/] he's made it clear that he's your enemy.",
        "[i]Whatever[/i] his motivations are,[p/] you'll overcome him.[p/] Just like everyone else.",
        "Tyrion: We should also head back, Celeste.",
        "Celeste: Right...",
        "No matter what it takes,[p/] you're going to see this through.",
        "Rath: Court is now resumed.[p/] Shall we pick up where we carried off?",
        "Rath: How would you like to proceed?",
        "Tyrion: I think we should review what we [i]do[/i] know about the murders.",
        "Lucio: Hmph...[p/] We [i]do[/i] have a plethora of witnesses to work with.",
        "Tyrion: That's correct...[p/] So let's start from the beginning.",
        "Tyrion: It all began at noon yesterday morning.",
        "Tyrion: I was at my house in Ratholme with Aria and my bodyguard: Celeste.",
        "Tyrion: I was speaking with them when a courier suddenly delivered a letter to my home.",
        "Tyrion: It was from Garrick Pierce.[p/] He wanted to meet with me and Celeste at the Grand Cathedral of the Scaled Lord at 2:00 PM.",
        "Tyrion: To make sure we were on time,[p/] we arrived at the Grand Cathedral at 1:00 PM.",
        "Tyrion: At the time,[p/] we didn't know that the cathedral was closed to the public.",
        "Tyrion: But the knights guarding the cathedral allowed us through anyways.",
        "Tyrion: Apparently,[p/] they were expecting us.",
        "Lucio: ...That should [i]not[/i] have been possible.",
        "Lucio: Due to the solemnity of the situation,[p/] we were very particular about who was permitted to enter the cathedral.",
        "Tyrion: It's possible someone pulled some strings to let us through.",
        "Lucio: ...[i]Or[/i] you two entered the Cathedral illegally.",
        "Tyrion: Well, I'm sure that knight from the Kingsguard can vouch for us.",
        "Lucio: I know about [i]every[/i] order given to the Kingsguard.",
        "Lucio: And [i]none[/i] of them were told to let you two through.",
        "Tyrion: ...It's possible the knight we met fell comatose like the others.",
        "Tyrion: And as long as they're unresponsive,[p/] we'll never know.",
        "Rath: Perhaps we should continue...",
        "Lucio: Hmph...",
        "Tyrion: Anyways,[p/] we arrived at the church and spent the next hour sightseeing before we went to meet with Pierce.",
        "Tyrion: In that time,[p/] we met with Remus,[p/] Lucio,[p/] Aria,[p/] Aster,[p/] and Alaric.",
        "Tyrion: And around that time,[p/] Aria and Aster left together to meet with the High Speaker in his quarters.",
        "Tyrion: While exploring the cathedral,[p/] we spoke with von Sanctus and Sibyl.",
        "Tyrion: Then we spoke with the three Frega sisters and Eris Illmater.",
        "Lucio: Eris Illmater?",
        "Tyrion: She's a friend of Beatrice Frega.",
        "Tyrion: The Kingsguard wouldn't let her bring her familiar into the cathedral.",
        "Tyrion: So she brought Eris to guide her instead.",
        "Lucio: Hm...",
        "Tyrion: Anyways,[p/] we left the garden at around 1:45 PM to meet with Pierce in the Prayer Room.",
        "Tyrion: And at around the same time,[p/] Aria left her meeting with the High Speaker and felt nauseous.",
        "Tyrion: The last thing she remembers is looking at Lake Galakrond.",
        "Lucio: A [i]likely[/i] story.",
        "Tyrion: [i]Regardless[/i],[p/] at 2:00 PM,[p/] Aster went to pay respects to his father's body.",
        "Tyrion: Unbeknownst to him,[p/] a mage had placed a [b]Glyph of Contingency[/b] in front of his father's coffin.",
        "Tyrion: It was set to trap him within a [b]Force Cage[/b].",
        "Rath: What a despicable act...",
        "Lucio: Considering what followed,[p/] the attack on His Majesty must have been a diversion...",
        "Tyrion: Right...",
        "Tyrion: It was also at this time that both Beatrice and Eris went missing.",
        "Tyrion: Considering the timing of it all,[p/] someone must have taken control of Beatrice's body [i]after[/i] the trap on Aster was sprung.",
        "Lucio: ...And are you saying this \"Patron\" controlled [i]her[/i] as well?",
        "Tyrion: No.[p/] I don't think so...",
        "Tyrion: According to her Contract,[p/] her mind belongs to the Empress of Discord,[p/] not the Patron.",
        "Tyrion: Furthermore,[p/] Aria's Blood Contract was [i]created[/i] by the Empress.",
        "Tyrion: It's clear that the Patron and the Empress were in league with each other.",
        "Lucio: ...Wonderful.[p/] [i]Another[/i] demon we have to worry about.",
        "Tyrion: ...Anyways,[p/] the Patron and the Empress had all of the pieces they needed.",
        "Tyrion: That's when they began the massacre.",
        "Tyrion: The Patron took control of Aria's body.[p/] And they used her to murder von Sanctus at 2:05 PM.",
        "Tyrion: Presumably,[p/] Aria started a fire in the Common Room around this time.",
        "Tyrion: And since von Sanctus's body was found there,[p/] this must have been after she murdered him.",
        "Tyrion: Shortly after,[p/] Prince Alaric spotted smoke from the fire and asked Aria what was going on.",
        "Tyrion: Aria responded by using an unknown [b]transmutation[/b] spell to incapacitate him.",
        "Lucio: To think they would use her to attack the prince as well...",
        "Tyrion: Luckily,[p/] the effects of that spell were only temporary,[p/] and Alaric came out unharmed.",
        "Tyrion: After this,[p/] the patron used Aria to murder Sibyl at 2:15 PM.",
        "Tyrion: She brought Sibyl's body to the westward balcony,[p/] where she dumped it into Lake Galakrond.",
        "Tyrion: High Speaker Archeus witnessed this.[p/] But he wasn't aware of what she'd thrown off the balcony until much later.",
        "Tyrion: The High Speaker thought this encounter was strange.[p/] But he continued with his business.",
        "Tyrion: He headed to the Prayer Room.[p/] But was turned away by the knights standing guard there.",
        "Tyrion: Meanwhile,[p/] Celeste and I were...[p/] [i]talking[/i] to Lord Pierce.",
        "Tyrion: When we showed up for the meeting earlier,[p/] he was clearly expecting someone else to show up.",
        "Tyrion: We tried to get to the bottom of what was happening.[p/] But he refused to answer our questions.",
        "Tyrion: And at about 2:20 PM we heard a commotion outside.",
        "Tyrion: Celeste went to investigate.",
        "Tyrion: ...And that's when Celeste fought Aria.",
        "Tyrion: The Patron's target was Garrick Pierce,[p/] but Celeste was too powerful to neutralize.",
        "Tyrion: They fought each other for about fifteen minutes before Aria was finally able to push past her.",
        "Lucio: ...",
        "Tyrion: During their fight,[p/] the Empress sent Beatrice into the Prayer Room.",
        "Tyrion: She probably made Beatrice invisible to move undetected.",
        "Tyrion: She then used her to cast a [b]Sleep[/b] spell on Pierce and me to knock us out.",
        "Tyrion: I remember checking the time close to when this happened.",
        "Tyrion: This must have happened at 2:30 PM.",
        "Lucio: ...If your testimony is correct,[p/] Beatrice Frega was actively used in this plan.",
        "Tyrion: Yes...[p/] And considering how quickly the massacre unfolded,[p/] the Empress must have coordinated with the Patron.",
        "Tyrion: They probably planned how they would use Beatrice and Aria to carry out the murders.",
        "Tyrion: Anyways,[p/] after Beatrice knocked us out,[p/] Aria finally pushed past Celeste and entered the Prayer Room.",
        "Tyrion: And before Celeste could chase after her,[p/] she had already murdered Pierce.",
        "Tyrion: Aria and I were already unconscious by the time Celeste entered the room.",
        "Tyrion: The Patron had already achieved their goal of murdering the three nobles.",
        "Tyrion: So she probably fell unconscious after they released their control over her.",
        "Tyrion: Aria and I regained consciousness shortly after.",
        "Tyrion: That's when the Inquisition arrested her for the murders.",
        "Lucio: Hm...[p/] Lord Pierce was one of the victims.",
        "Lucio: Your meeting clearly had more significance than I'd realized.",
        "Lucio: So tell us, Cuthbert.[p/][s/] What was your discussion about?",
        "Tyrion: ...",
        "Celeste: ...It's fine.[p/] You can tell them.",
        "Tyrion: Alright...[p/] as long as it's okay with you.",
        "Tyrion: ...For the past few months,[p/] Celeste and I have been investigating who her birth parents are.",
        "Lucio: Hmph...[p/] I recall receiving many complaints about her during the Lords' Ball.",
        "Tyrion: Supposedly,[p/] Garrick Pierce had the information we were seeking.",
        "Tyrion: That letter he sent us said that he wanted to \"trade this information for his freedom\".",
        "Tyrion: I [i]assumed[/i] this meant that he wanted me to be his attorney.",
        "Lucio: Do you honestly expect us to believe that?!",
        "Lucio: Why would he ask for help from the attorney who indicted him in the first place?!",
        "Tyrion: [i]We[/i] thought the same thing.",
        "Tyrion: And when we arrived for the meeting,[p/] it was clear [i]I[/i] wasn't the intended recipient.",
        "Tyrion: This means that Pierce sent that letter to someone else.",
        "Rath: ...",
        "Lucio: ...You better not be lying to us, Cuthbert.",
        "Tyrion: Frankly,[p/] I don't much care if you believe me.",
        "Tyrion: Regardless,[p/] if we examine every action Aria took,[p/] we can build a psychological profile of the Patron.",
        "Lucio: ...I [i]will[/i] give you that.",
        "Tyrion: To begin,[p/] the defense would like to call the Inquisition Commander to the stand.",
        "Tyrion: His testimony might shed some light on how von Sanctus and Sibyl died.",
        "Tyrion: Despite all these witness accounts,[p/] we still only know how [i]Pierce[/i] was murdered.",
        "Lucio: Yes...[p/] He was impaled using a blade magically frozen from his own blood.",
        "In a grim sort of way,[p/] it's almost poetic that he died the same way Flinhart did.",
        "But you doubt that will give Celeste any kind of closure.",
        "Tyrion: Anyways,[p/] we need to find out [i]exactly[/i] how Aria murdered von Sanctus and Sibyl.",
        "Tyrion: The massacre was swift and efficient.",
        "Tyrion: It must've required a lot of forethought and coordination.",
        "Tyrion: If we figured out who might've had this knowledge,[p/] we might be able to find out who did this.",
        "Rath: I see...[p/] That sounds as good a plan as any.",
        "Lucio: Kingsguard![p/][s/] Escort Commander Orym White to the witness stand!",
        "Lucio: Witness.[p/] Please state your name and occupation.",
        "Orym: R-[p/][s/]Right...[p/][s/] I...[p/][s/] Um...",
        "Orym: ...",
        "Tyrion: Commander?",
        "Orym: I'm sorry![p/][s/] I just can't do this!",
        "Orym: How am I supposed to act like this is normal?!",
        "Orym: A giant lizard is standing [i]right[/i] behind me!",
        "Rath: ...Calling me a lizard is [i]highly[/i] offensive, commander.",
        "Orym: S-[p/][s/]Sorry, your scaled lordship...[p/] sir...",
        "Tyrion: Commander...[p/] Just try your best to testify about what happened.",
        "Orym: Y-[p/][s/]Yeah...",
        "Orym: It all started when we received a report from the Kingsguard.[p/] The prosecutor attacked Prince Alaric and a fire had broken out in the Common Room.",
        "Orym: We weren't sure what the deal with Steelwind was.[p/] So we went to the Common Room to put out the fire.",
        "Orym: But when we got there,[p/] we noticed a bunch of unconscious knights in front of the Prayer Room.",
        "Orym: We went to the Prayer Room.[p/] That's when we found Steelwind and Cuthbert unconscious next to Pierce's dead body.",
        "Orym: We later found the bodies of von Sanctus and Sibyl too.[p/] That's when we realized that she offed all three of them.",
        "Tyrion: So you still have no idea how Steelwind was used to murder von Sanctus or Sibyl?",
        "Orym: Not a clue.",
        "Orym: It's especially worse for von Sanctus.[p/] That fire burned a lot of the physical evidence off of his body.",
        "Tyrion: What about Sibyl?[p/] Was there any physical evidence on her body?",
        "Orym: No idea about that either.[p/] She didn't have any wounds either.",
        "Orym: All we know is that she died of suffocation.",
        "Hm...[p/] There's definitely more information you can glean from their investigation.",
        "Orym: It all started when we received a report from the Kingsguard.[p/] The prosecutor attacked Prince Alaric and a fire had broken out in the Common Room.",
        "Tyrion: And this is mainly based on Prince Alaric's testimony.[p/] Am I correct?",
        "Orym: Yeah.[p/] We still have no idea which [b]transmutation[/b] spell she hit him with.",
        "Tyrion: Judging from the time of the report,[p/] this must have been well after all three of the murders occurred.",
        "Orym: Yeah.[p/] It was unfortunate how that played out.",
        "Orym: If Steelwind really [i]was[/i] controlled,[p/] whoever controlled her knew how to get the job done quickly.",
        "That leaves the question of how they did this so efficiently.",
        "Orym: We weren't sure what the deal with Steelwind was.[p/] So we went to the Common Room to put out the fire.",
        "Tyrion: Was that wise?",
        "Tyrion: Regardless of who it was,[p/] someone assaulted a Prince of Wyverngarde.",
        "Orym: We were already dealing with the King who was trapped in that [b]Force Cage[/b].",
        "Orym: Honestly,[p/] a [i]lot[/i] happened in that hour.",
        "Orym: And most of our attention was focused on keeping the royal family safe.",
        "Lucio: We can already conclude that the attack on the King was a distraction.",
        "Lucio: Whoever orchestrated this must have known we'd focus our attention on keeping the royal family safe.",
        "You suppose that makes sense.[p/] And the casualties still included many knights from the Kingsguard.",
        "They probably had to spread their forces thin to protect everyone else [i]and[/i] handle the fire in the Common Room.",
        "Lucio: What did you do when you arrived at the Common Room, commander?",
        "Orym: When we got there,[p/] we noticed a bunch of unconscious knights in front of the Prayer Room.",
        "Tyrion: Did you see Aria or Celeste?",
        "Orym: No...[p/] We only saw the aftermath of their fight.",
        "Orym: There were marks and craters everywhere in that hallway.",
        "Lucio: Pierce's time of death was 2:45 PM.",
        "Lucio: And the knights didn't arrive at the Common Room until 3:10 PM.",
        "Lucio: They didn't arrive at the Prayer Room until well after the battle had taken place.",
        "Tyrion: Wait...[p/] Wouldn't that mean you were in that room with Pierce's body for twenty-five minutes?",
        "Tyrion: Why didn't you look for help?",
        "Celeste: Y-[p/][s/]You weren't waking up for some reason.[p/] So I kept channeling my healing magic into you.",
        "Celeste: Looking back,[p/] I probably should have just looked for help.",
        "Celeste: But even if Aria was unconscious,[p/] I didn't want to leave you alone in that room with her...",
        "Tyrion: R-[p/][s/]Right...[p/] Sorry...",
        "Recalling that moment is clearly taking a toll on her mind.",
        "You should be more careful.",
        "Orym: We went to the Prayer Room.[p/] That's when we found Steelwind and Cuthbert unconscious next to Pierce's dead body.",
        "Tyrion: Judging from the timing,[p/] this would have been several minutes after he'd already died.",
        "Orym: Yeah.[p/] And we had no idea what was going on.",
        "Orym: Pierce was already dead.[p/] And you and Steelwind were unresponsive.",
        "Tyrion: I can see why [i]I'd[/i] be unresponsive.[p/] I was hit with a spell specifically designed to make people sleep.",
        "Tyrion: But why would Aria be unresponsive too?",
        "Orym: We have no idea.[p/] We've never even [i]heard[/i] of demonic possession until today.",
        "Orym: For all we know,[p/] it could've all been a side effect of being controlled for over an hour.",
        "You suppose that makes sense.[p/] But could that common thread truly be a mere coincidence?",
        "Orym: We later found the bodies of von Sanctus and Sibyl too.[p/] That's when we realized that she offed all three of them.",
        "Hm...[p/] That last statement was a little vague.",
        "Perhaps you should ask him to elaborate more on one of the murders.",
        "Orym: Steelwind must have attacked von Sanctus in the Common Room and suffocated him somehow.",
        "Tyrion: And due to the lack of physical evidence,[p/] you're not sure what she used.",
        "Lucio: von Sanctus and Sibyl both died via suffocation.",
        "Lucio: We can probably assume that the Patron used the same method to murder both of them.",
        "Tyrion: ...Well you know what they say about assuming.",
        "Lucio: ...Don't be cute, Cuthbert.",
        "Celeste: He can't help it.",
        "Tyrion: ...What?",
        "Celeste: ...What?",
        "...[i]Anyways[/i],[p/] Lucio's assumption [i]does[/i] make sense.[p/] But you don't want to jump to conclusions yet.",
        "Either way,[p/] is [i]von Sanctus[/i] the victim you want to focus on?",
        "Perhaps you should ask him to elaborate on one of the other murders.",
        "Orym: From the burns on his body,[p/] she must have hit him with a [b]Fire Bolt[/b] to keep him from getting away.[p/] He didn't have anything to defend himself with.",
        "Tyrion: Right...[p/] [b]Fire Bolt[/b] [i]is[/i] in her [b]Spell Compendium[/b].",
        "Tyrion: And von Sanctus wasn't exactly a fighter, after all.",
        "Orym: Yeah...[p/] The poor sap didn't have a chance.",
        "Orym: He must have been in immense pain from that attack.",
        "Lucio: ...",
        "Orym: Steelwind must have attacked Sibyl somewhere close to that balcony.[p/] And going by the autopsy report,[p/] she must have suffocated her somehow.",
        "Tyrion: And since someone cast [b]Mend Wounds[/b] on the body,[p/] we still don't know how.",
        "Orym: Yeah...[p/] It's going to be a real headache figuring that out.",
        "You're compelled to agree with him.[p/] No one saw the murder.",
        "The High Speaker only witnessed the moment Aria dumped the body,[p/] and even [i]he[/i] didn't see that much.",
        "Anyways,[p/] is Sibyl the victim you want to focus on?",
        "Perhaps you should ask him to elaborate on one of the other murders.",
        "Orym: We later discovered her body in Lake Galakrond.[p/] From the High Speaker's testimony,[p/] Steelwind must have dumped her body from the balcony above.",
        "Tyrion: How did you know her body was there anyways?",
        "Orym: When bodies started dropping,[p/] we noticed that she was nowhere to be found.",
        "Orym: One of the Kingsguard cast [b]Locate Creature[/b], and realized she was somewhere in the lake.",
        "Orym: It took us an hour before we finally fished her out.",
        "Lucio: Based on the High Speaker's testimony,[p/] she was dead long before that.",
        "Orym: From McCoy's testimony,[p/] we know that Steelwind killed Pierce in the Prayer Room.",
        "Tyrion: Out of all the murders,[p/] Pierce's is the one we have the most information about.",
        "Orym: Yeah.[p/] From what it sounds like,[p/] this Patron wasn't planning to let McCoy live.",
        "Orym: That drawn-out fight must have really thrown a wrench into their plans.",
        "Lucio: I find [i]that[/i] a little strange though...",
        "Tyrion: ...How so?",
        "Lucio: My daughter is a worthless soldier.[p/] She has no talent for combat.",
        "Lucio: And [i]I've[/i] experienced McCoy's battle prowess firsthand.",
        "Lucio: As much as I hate to admit it,[p/] McCoy should have easily overcome her in an even fight.",
        "Celeste: I-[p/]It was her magic that was the problem.",
        "Celeste: And I had no idea what kind of spells she could throw at me.[p/] So I had to be careful.",
        "Celeste: ...And despite everything,[p/] I [i]really[/i] didn't want to hurt her.",
        "Lucio: Hm...[p/] That kindness could be the death of you, McCoy.",
        "Tyrion: ...",
        "...It'd be better to just let that slide.",
        "Anyways,[p/] is Pierce the victim you want to focus on?",
        "Perhaps you should ask him to elaborate on one of the other murders.",
        "Orym: She probably didn't have time to suffocate him like the other two.[p/] So she must have improvised a weapon using [b]Shape Liquid[/b].",
        "Tyrion: ...Which is strangely similar to how he murdered Flinhart McCoy.",
        "Lucio: Lord Pierce [i]was[/i] one of the targets of the Patron.",
        "Lucio: It's likely they knew about what happened during McCoy's trials and drew inspiration from that.",
        "Tyrion: Still, though...[p/] It seems awfully creative for something that they came up with at the moment.",
        "Lucio: Well...[p/] Don't the legends say that [i]demons[/i] engage in contrapasso?",
        "Orym: ...Say what now?",
        "Tyrion: Some people believe that when souls are sent to hell,[p/] they're punished in a way that relates to their sins.",
        "Tyrion: In Pierce's case,[p/] he committed murder with a frozen blade.",
        "Tyrion: It's possible this Empress wanted the Patron to murder him in the same way.",
        "...Although,[p/] you still can't say for sure...",
        "Player: Overflow",
        "Despite how much you know,[p/] there are a lot of details missing about how von Sanctus and Sibyl died.",
        "But the Inquisition might have found some clues that you missed.",
        "You should have the commander elaborate on what they know about each of the murders.",
        "Player: Objection",
        "Player: Force Cage|Von Sanctus's Spell Compendium",
        "Player: Default",
        "Tyrion: Your Grace![p/][s/] It's clear that the witness's testimony is contradictory!",
        "Tyrion: And [i]this[/i] piece of evidence proves it!",
        "Rath: I fail to see how [i]that[/i] proves anything, Mr. Cuthbert...",
        "Tyrion: O-[p/]Oh...[p/] I guess you're right.",
        "Player: Back",
        "But whose murder should he elaborate on?",
        "Lloyd von Sanctus",
        "Tyrion: Could you elaborate more on von Sanctus's murder?",
        "Tyrion: Was there any evidence that implied how he died?",
        "Orym: Like I said,[p/] it's trickier with von Sanctus because the fire partially burned his body.",
        "Orym: And our [b]divination[/b] magic could only tell that he died of suffocation.",
        "Tyrion: I see.[p/] So there's no other physical evidence.",
        "Orym: Well, there [i]is[/i] one thing.",
        "Orym: From his burn marks,[p/] we [i]do[/i] know that he was hit with a [b]Fire Bolt[/b] before he died.",
        "Orym: We're guessing she wanted to weaken him before she dealt the final blow.",
        "Tyrion: So he took a direct attack from her before he died.",
        "Coraline Sibyl",
        "Tyrion: Could you elaborate more on Sibyl's murder?",
        "Tyrion: Was there any evidence that implied how she died?",
        "Orym: Using our [b]divination[/b] magic,[p/] we know she died of suffocation.",
        "Orym: But we're not exactly sure how.",
        "Tyrion: But unlike von Sanctus,[p/] Sibyl's body wasn't burned.",
        "Tyrion: Shouldn't there have been wounds around her neck if she was suffocated?",
        "Orym: Well, we found traces of [b]necromancy[/b] on Sibyl.",
        "Orym: We think Steelwind cast [b]Mend Wounds[/b] on her body after she offed her.",
        "Orym: This would've removed any wounds on the body.",
        "Tyrion: ...It's exactly like what happened with Catherine Bellwether.",
        "Orym: Yeah...[p/] The only wounds she has are from the impact of falling into Lake Galakrond.",
        "Garrick Pierce",
        "Tyrion: Could you elaborate more on Pierce's murder?",
        "Tyrion: Was there any evidence that implied how he died?",
        "Orym: Well, [i]that[/i] one is simple.",
        "Orym: McCoy chased Steelwind into the Prayer Room but didn't arrive fast enough.",
        "Orym: When she got there,[p/] Pierce was already dead.",
        "Orym: He was killed using a blade magically formed from his own blood.",
        "Tyrion: ...But why would she do something like that?",
        "Tyrion: When he murdered Flinhart McCoy,[p/] he only used [b]Shape Liquid[/b] to avoid leaving behind any evidence.",
        "Tyrion: I doubt the Patron would make Steelwind do the same thing.",
        "Tyrion: Their intent was to pin the crime on her.",
        "Orym: We think she knew McCoy was on her tail.",
        "Orym: She didn't have enough time to suffocate him as she did with von Sanctus and Sibyl.",
        "Orym: And she didn't have any weapons on her.[p/] She must have had to improvise.",
        "Tyrion: But she [i]has[/i] other spells that could've done the job.",
        "Tyrion: She could have hit him with a [b]Steelwind Strike[/b].",
        "Lucio: Hmph...[p/] I know from experience that she is [i]terrible[/i] at controlling that spell.",
        "Lucio: It's possible she didn't want to unleash such a powerful spell in a closed room.",
        "That [i]sort[/i] of tracks.[p/] But it still doesn't feel right...",
        "But you can't really refute it now.[p/] It'd be best to move on.",
        "Tyrion: Anyways,[p/] the other two murders were really well planned.",
        "Tyrion: Pierce's murder was the only one that required improvisation.",
        "Lucio: It's possible the Patron severely underestimated McCoy's combat capabilities.",
        "Lucio: She fought my daughter for almost half an hour.",
        "Lucio: Meanwhile,[p/] the other two murders occurred within quick succession of one another.",
        "Tyrion: Yeah.[p/] I see what you mean.",
        "No One's",
        "You decide to keep the testimony as is for now.",
        "Perhaps there's something there you can still use.",
        "Tyrion: Anyways,[p/] please add this to your testimony, Commander White.",
        "Orym: Sure.[p/] Whatever you say, kid.",
        "Tyrion: Hm...[p/] That's strange.",
        "Lucio: ...What is it now?",
        "Tyrion: Commander White.[p/] You said that Steelwind attacked von Sanctus with a [b]Fire Bolt[/b] [i]before[/i] she suffocated him.",
        "Orym: Yeah.[p/] She probably wanted to injure him so he'd be easier to subdue.",
        "Tyrion: But [i]that's[/i] what I find strange.",
        "Tyrion: Von Sanctus knew he was under attack.",
        "Tyrion: So wouldn't he cast [b]Force Cage[/b] to repel her?",
        "Orym: ...Hm.[p/] I guess that's true.",
        "Lucio: Von Sanctus was hardly a warrior, Cuthbert.",
        "Lucio: Force Cage is an extremely useful spell.[p/] But it [i]has[/i] to be aimed.",
        "Lucio: He was hit with a [b]Fire Bolt[/b],[p/] and he must have been in immense pain.",
        "Lucio: I doubt he'd be able to think clearly under those circumstances.",
        "Tyrion: I'd normally agree with you.[p/] But the crime scene tells another story.",
        "Rath: What do you mean, Mr. Cuthbert?",
        ":Von Sanctus: Traces of Abjuration",
        "Default",
        "No...[p/] Steelwind's is somewhat believable.",
        "But you remember there's something you found at the crime scene.",
        "And it tells you whether von Sanctus cast [b]Force Cage[/b] or not.",
        "Tyrion: When we investigated the crime scene,[p/] we found traces of [b]abjuration[/b] magic that formed a perfect square around the body.",
        "Tyrion: I'm sure if we measured the dimensions of that square,[p/] it would be 10ft by 10ft.",
        "Lucio: ...Which is the same length and width as the cube created by [b]Force Cage[/b].",
        "Tyrion: Like you said,[p/] he was in no shape to aim it.",
        "Tyrion: So he cast [b]Force Cage[/b] on [i]himself[/i] to create a makeshift barrier.",
        "Lucio: Nonsense![p/][s/] If von Sanctus [i]had[/i] cast [b]Force Cage[/b] on himself,[p/] he should have been protected from further harm.",
        "Lucio: The defendant wouldn't have been able to suffocate him after that.",
        "Tyrion: ...Perhaps there's some way to [i]bypass[/i] [b]Force Cage[/b].",
        "Lucio: And [i]once[/i] again,[p/] your ignorance of the Arcane Arts is made apparent.",
        "Lucio: [b]Force Cage[/b] is one of the most powerful [b]abjuration[b/] spells in existence.",
        "Lucio: It can't be dispelled,[p/] and [i]no one[/i] could teleport into or out of it.",
        "Tyrion: Right...[p/] Aster was also trapped in a [b]Force Cage[/b].",
        "Tyrion: And [i]he[/i] had to wait for the hour duration to elapse.",

        "Tyrion: If [b]Force Cage[/b] is a perfectly closed space,[p/] is it possible that he ran out of air?",
        "Lucio: That would be a [i]glaring[/i] weakness.",
        "Lucio: House von Sanctus obviously designed that spell to allow oxygen through the barrier.",
        "Lucio: ...And before you ask,[p/] poisonous gases can't be pushed through the barrier either.",
        "Lucio: Only oxygen can travel through it.",
        "Tyrion: Right...[p/] And even if they [i]had[/i] used poisonous gas,[p/] the autopsy report wouldn't have said he was suffocated.",
        "Only oxygen can travel through the bounds of a [b]Force Cage[/b].",

        "Tyrion: But what if there was no oxygen [i]left[/i] in the room?",
        "Lucio: No oxygen...?",
        "Lucio: ...Ah,[p/] I see.",
        "Rath: It was the fire in the Common Room.",
        "Rath: The Patron knew Aria couldn't harm von Sanctus once he was in that [b]Force Cage[/b].",
        "Rath: So she started a fire to eat all of the oxygen within the room.",
        "{0}",
        "Tyrion: What [i]should[/i] have protected him ended up trapping him.",
        "Tyrion: And the inability to dispel it ended up sealing his fate.",
        "Rath: Well, I suppose that explains how the defendant murdered von Sanctus.",
        "Rath: But with that in mind...[p/] a [i]lot[/i] of this plan sounds like it was improvised at the moment.",
        "Tyrion: Just like the murder of Pierce...",
        "Tyrion: And not only that.[p/] We assumed that the Patron used the same method to kill both Lord von Sanctus and Lady Sibyl.",
        "Tyrion: But I doubt Lady Sibyl died under the same circumstances.",
        "Lucio: Correct...[p/] There was only [i]one[/i] fire.",
        "Lucio: And if Sibyl was in that [b]Force Cage[/b],[p/] the defendant wouldn't have been able to throw her body into Lake Galakrond.",
        "Lucio: Which means Sibyl must have died by asphyxiation elsewhere.",
        "Rath: Then it's clear our next course of action is to determine how [i]Lady Sibyl[/i] was murdered.",
        "Tyrion: *sigh*[p/] But we still don't know [i]where[/i] she was murdered.",
        "Rath: And the only witness who saw her around this time was the High Speaker.",
        "Lucio: ...Which was [i]after[/i] the defendant disposed of Sibyl's body.",
        "Tyrion: Well,[p/] the High Speaker's testimony is as good a start as any.",
        "Tyrion: For our next witness,[p/] the defence would like to call High Speaker Theon Archeus to the stand.",
        "Rath: ...",
        "Tyrion: What's wrong?",
        "Rath: ...It's nothing.[p/] Please carry on.",
        "Lucio: Kingsguard![p/][s/] Escort High Speaker Archeus to the witness stand!",
        "Lucio: Witness.[p/] You will testify about-.",
        "Theon: Oh, great and [i]blessed[/i] Scaled Lord!",
        "Theon: To think you would grace us with your presence!",
        "Rath: ...Oh my god.",
        "Theon: A-[p/][s/]Ah...!",
        "Theon: Forgive me, Lord Rathallion![p/][s/] I spoke out of turn! [mind=\"He must think I'm an arrogant fool!\"/]",
        "Wow...[p/] It looks like the [i]witness[/i] is schmoozing the judge for once.",
        "Rath: How many times do I have to tell you people that I'm [i]not[/i] a god!",
        "Rath: [i]Yes[/i]...[p/] I revere and serve the God of Dragons.[p/] But I'm [i]not[/i] Bahamut's avatar!",
        "Theon: B-[p/][s/]But...[p/][s/] You're the [i]Scaled Lord[/i]!",
        "Rath: I'm just a [i]dragon[/i].[p/][s/] I'm not even a [i]powerful[/i] one!",
        "Rath: I'm [i]not[/i] a deity!",
        "Theon: ...This humility.",
        "Theon: That's [i]exactly[/i] what Bahamut's avatar would say.",
        "Rath: I swear to god...",
        "Theon: He even swears by the god's name.",
        "Rath: ...Lucio,[p/] please handle this.",
        "Lucio: Perhaps [i]another[/i] approach is warranted.",
        "Lucio: High Speaker Archeus![p/][s/] The Great and [i]Powerful[/i] Rathallion calls upon you today!",
        "Lucio: We require your-!",
        "Theon: You require my blood?!",
        "Theon: Of course![p/][s/] I will gladly give my [i]life[/i] for the Scaled Lord!",
        "Lucio: ...What?![p/][s/] No!",
        "Theon: Of course![p/][s/] My blood could [i]never[/i] be enough!",
        "Lucio: Would you just let me-?!",
        "Theon: I will do as you wish, my Lord!",
        "Theon: It might take some time, though.",
        "Theon: I'll need some time to gather some followers and-.",
        "Rath: Oh my god![p/][s/] We [i]just[/i] want your testimony!",
        "Rath: ...Just tell us what you saw when Ms. Steelwind was at the west-ward balcony yesterday.",
        "Theon: ...O-[p/][s/]Oh, I see.",
        "Theon: If [i]that's[/i] what you truly wish, my Lord.",
        "Tyrion: ...Are we just going to [i]ignore[/i] how ready he was to commit mass murder?",
        "Lucio: Be quiet![p/][s/] We [i]just[/i] got him to calm down!",
        "Theon: I was doing some paperwork in my quarters and I suppose I lost track of the time.[p/] My alarm went off and I realized that it was time for my afternoon prayers.",
        "Theon: I began heading to the Prayer Room when I spotted Lady Steelwind looking over the west-ward balcony.",
        "Theon: I tried to greet her but she didn't respond to me.[p/] That's when I noticed she was pushing something large over the balcony and into Lake Galakrond.",
        "Theon: I asked her what she was doing.[p/] But again,[p/] she ignored me and went towards the Prayer Room.",
        "Theon: I thought nothing of it and made my way there as well.[p/] That's when the guards there turned me away.",
        "Theon: I went back to my quarters to do my Prayers there.",
        "Tyrion: Considering the timing of it all,[p/] this must have all happened minutes before she began attacking the Prayer Room.",
        "Theon: Yes...[p/] I consider myself lucky.[p/] The Scaled Lord must have graced me with divine luck.",
        "Rath: Please.[p/] Just...[p/] stop.",
        "Considering how quickly she was moving,[p/] there [i]has[/i] to be a reason why she waited there.",
        "Was she waiting for the High Speaker to leave?",
        "Perhaps you should closely examine the timing of these events.",
        "Theon: I was doing some paperwork in my quarters and I suppose I lost track of the time.[p/] My alarm went off and I realized that it was time for my afternoon prayers.",
        "Tyrion: An alarm?",
        "Theon: It's a rudimentary artificery device.[p/] I use it to remind me to conduct daily prayers.",
        "Tyrion: ...I see.[p/] And do you have it set to go off at a specific time?",
        "Theon: Yes.[p/] It's set to go off at 2:10 PM: five minutes before my afternoon prayers.",
        "Theon: I was in my quarters when my alarm went off at 2:10 PM.[p/] I realized that it was time for my afternoon prayers.",
        "Tyrion: So you usually say your afternoon prayers at 2:15 PM?",
        "Theon: Yes.[p/] It is said that time is the holiest hour of the God of Dragons: Bahamut.",
        "Rath: ...This is the first [i]I've[/i] heard of this.",
        "Theon: Was I mistaken?!",
        "Theon: Forgive me, my lord![p/] I can't believe I've dishonored your deity!",
        "Rath: Ugh...[p/] You know what?",
        "Rath: Just forget I said anything...",
        "Theon: I began heading to the Prayer Room when I spotted Lady Steelwind looking over the west-ward balcony.",
        "Tyrion: What was her expression like?",
        "Theon: It was very cold and emotionless.",
        "Lucio: ...The Patron must have had control of her when this happened.",
        "Theon: Yes.[p/] That certainly makes the most sense.",
        "Tyrion: Right...[p/]",
        "Tyrion: What time did this happen?",
        "Theon: It was shortly after my alarm went off.[p/] It would definitely be before 2:15 PM.",
        "Theon: I began heading to the Prayer Room when I spotted Lady Steelwind looking over the west-ward balcony.[p/] This happened before 2:15 PM.",
        "Tyrion: So she was looking over Lake Galakrond?",
        "Theon: Knowing what I know now,[p/] it's possible that she was making sure she could throw Lady Sibyl's body [i]into[/i] the lake from there.",
        "Tyrion: But she was clearly fine with [i]you[/i] witnessing her act suspiciously.",
        "Tyrion: Why would she even go to the trouble of hiding Sibyl's body in the first place?",
        "Lucio: The patron clearly needed to delay when the murders were discovered.",
        "Lucio: The defendant wasn't able to murder Pierce until much later, after all.",
        "You suppose that makes sense.[p/] But they probably didn't [i]plan[/i] to fight Celeste for that long.",
        "There [i]has[/i] to be a reason why she threw Sibyl's body into the lake.",
        "Theon: I tried to greet her but she didn't respond to me.[p/] That's when I noticed she was pushing something large over the balcony and into Lake Galakrond.",
        "Tyrion: So she ignored you?[p/] What was her expression like?",
        "Theon: It was very cold and emotionless.",
        "Lucio: ...The Patron must have had control of her when this happened.",
        "Theon: Yes.[p/] That certainly makes the most sense.",
        "Tyrion: What time did this encounter happen?",
        "Theon: It was shortly after my alarm went off.[p/] It was definitely before 2:15 PM.",
        "Theon: It was still before 2:15 PM.[p/] Our encounter was short.[p/] That's when I noticed she was pushing something large over the balcony and into Lake Galakrond.",
        "Tyrion: ...And that must have been Sibyl's body.",
        "Theon: ...I suppose so.",
        "Tyrion: ...You don't sound so sure of it yourself.",
        "Theon: It's just that I recall Lady Sibyl's garb to be much brighter.",
        "Theon: Meanwhile,[p/] the thing I saw Lady Steelwind throw over the balcony was much darker.",
        "Tyrion: Right...[p/] You mentioned that before.",
        "Lucio: It's clear it was just a trick of the sunlight.",
        "Lucio: That balcony is directly above where we found Lady Sibyl's body in Lake Galakrond.",
        "Lucio: You [i]obviously[/i] saw the defendant dumping the body.",
        "Lucio: What [i]else[/i] could it have been?",
        "Theon: Yes...[p/] I suppose you're right.",
        "Theon: I asked her what she was doing.[p/] But again,[p/] she ignored me and went towards the Prayer Room.",
        "Tyrion: The Patron was probably trying to keep her on track.",
        "Tyrion: But I'm surprised she didn't attack you.",
        "Tyrion: Even if the Patron was trying to frame her,[p/] she hadn't killed Pierce yet.",
        "Theon: Yes.[p/] I'm a little confused about that myself.",
        "Theon: But perhaps I should just be happy I came out of that encounter unharmed.",
        "Tyrion: Anyways,[p/] how long did you talk to her?",
        "Theon: Our encounter was very brief since she was ignoring me.",
        "Theon: It couldn't have lasted for more than two minutes.",
        "Theon: I only spent about two minutes trying to speak with her.[p/] But she ignored me and went towards the Prayer Room.[p/]",
        "Tyrion: It must have been a short exchange then.",
        "Lucio: The Patron was controlling her at the time.",
        "Lucio: They must have been hoping that he would leave if she ignored him.",
        "But wouldn't it have been easier to just murder him then and there?",
        "She could have easily done it quickly and thrown his body into the lake.[p/] Just like she did with Sibyl.",
        "Theon: I thought nothing of it and made my way there as well.[p/] That's when the guards there turned me away.",
        "Tyrion: Right...[p/] And these guards are still comatose.",
        "It makes you uneasy that you [i]still[/i] don't have an explanation for that.",
        "Did the Empress of Discord use some kind of demonic magic to do that?",
        "The Eye of Horus doesn't leave magical traces.[p/] So it's possible that demonic magic is the same.",
        "Either way,[p/] it's awfully convenient he left right [i]before[/i] the attack on the Prayer Room happened.",
        "But you suppose you'll have to put a pin in that for now.",
        "Tyrion: Anyways,[p/] what time did this happen?",
        "Theon: I believe it was 2:15 PM.[p/] That's when I usually arrive at the Prayer Room.",
        "Theon: I thought nothing of it and made my way there as well.[p/] That's when the guards there turned me away at 2:15 PM.",
        "Tyrion: Right...[p/] And these guards are still comatose.",
        "It makes you uneasy that you [i]still[/i] don't have an explanation for that.",

        "But you suppose you'll have to put a pin in that for now.",
        "Theon: I went back to my quarters to do my Prayers there.",
        "Tyrion: You were in your quarters during the massacre?",
        "Theon: Yes.[p/] As I've mentioned before,[p/] my room is magically soundproof.",
        "Theon: My guards and I were woefully unaware of what was happening.",
        "Theon: We didn't know what was happening until some members of the Kingsguard came to inform me of what had happened to the King.",
        "So members of the Kingsguard were there with him. And he mentioned that his \"guards\" were there too.",
        "They can all probably verify this.[p/] But it's still a little hard to believe how close he came to harm that day.",
        "Tyrion: Anyways,[p/] how long were you in your quarters for?",
        "Theon: I waited there until the Kingsguard notified me that it was safe.",
        "Theon: I think I waited there until 3:15 PM.",
        "Which was around the time that Aria was arrested.",
        "Theon: I went back to my quarters to do my Prayers there.[p/] I was there until 3:15 PM.",
        "Tyrion: Which means you were in your quarters until the massacre ended.",
        "Tyrion: Did your guards see Steelwind during that time?",
        "Theon: No.[p/] They didn't.",
        "Theon: And all we knew was that His Majesty had been trapped.",
        "Theon: We had no idea Lady Steelwind had been attacking people at that point.",
        "Lucio: It's clear that the High Speaker wasn't one of the Patron's targets.",

        "Player: Default",
        "Tyrion: Your Grace![p/][s/] It's clear that the witness's testimony is contradictory!",
        "Tyrion: And [i]this[/i] piece of evidence proves it!",
        "Rath: I fail to see how [i]that[/i] proves anything, Mr. Cuthbert...",
        "Tyrion: O-[p/]Oh...[p/] I guess you're right.",

        "Tyrion: High Speaker.[p/] You said that you saw Aria dumping [i]something[/i] over the ledge of the balcony.",
        "Lucio: There's no need to be vague, Cuthbert.",
        "Lucio: It's clear from the evidence that he saw my daughter dumping Lady Sibyl's body.",
        "Tyrion: That's the thing, Lord Steelwind.[p/] It [i]couldn't[/i] have been Sibyl's [i]body[/i].",
        "Lucio: ...What are you talking about?",
        "Lucio: The location from that balcony to where we found Lady Sibyl's body lines up perfectly!",
        "Tyrion: That may be.[p/] But the witness just said he saw Aria dumping the body [i]before[/i] 2:15 PM.",
        "Lucio: ...",
        "Lucio: ...Wait.",
        "Tyrion: You see it too, don't you Lucio?",
        "Tyrion: How did Aria dump Coraline Sibyl's body into Lake Galakrond [i]before[/i] 2:15 PM...",
        "Tyrion: ...if her time of death was 2:[i]18[/i] PM?!",
        "Rath: I see...[p/] That [i]does[/i] seem peculiar.",
        "Lucio: But we [i]know[/i] the defendant threw Sibyl's body from that balcony.",
        "Lucio: There would be no other explanation for how it ended up there.",
        "Tyrion: Yes...[p/] That's also true.",
        "Rath: Perhaps she was still alive when Aria threw her off of that balcony.",
        "Rath: She could have been knocked unconscious with a [b]Sleep[/b] spell.",
        "Lucio: Your Grace.[p/] There were no traces of [b]conjuration[/b] magic on her body.",

        ":If the High Speaker saw her dumping Sibyl at 2:18 PM,[p/] he would have been close enough to hear the fight break out.",
        "She could have only died after Aria dumped her off the ledge.",
        "Player: She died while she was falling",
        "Did she die [i]while[/i] she was falling?",
        "No...[p/] The cause of death was suffocation.",
        "Aria couldn't have possibly suffocated her while she was falling toward Lake Galakrond.",
        "There were no wounds on the body.[p/] This means Aria couldn't have obstructed her airway [i]after[/i] she was thrown off of the balcony.",
        "Player: She died after she hit the water",
        "Tyrion: She must have died [i]after[/i] she hit the water.",

        "Tyrion: She might have had the opportunity to cast a spell to protect herself.",

        "Rath: That \"object\" was actually Lady Sibyl protected by a layer of stone.",

        "Tyrion: She cast [b]Stone Skin[/b] on herself [i]before[/i] she was thrown into the lake.",
        "Tyrion: Aria must have attacked her.[p/] And she cast that spell in response.",

        "Tyrion: It was [b]Hold Creature[/b]!",
        "Tyrion: Sibyl must have cast [b]Stone Skin[/b] on herself when Aria attacked her.",
        "Tyrion: The Patron must have known that Aria couldn't physically damage her like that.",
        "Tyrion: So they ordered her to restrain Sibyl with that spell!",
        "Lucio: ...!",
        "Lucio: And Sibyl died by suffocation...",
        "Tyrion: That's right, Lucio.",
        "Tyrion: Even if she was restrained,[p/] Sibyl was still protected by [b]Stone Skin[/b].",
        "Tyrion: That would've left only [i]one[/i] option for the Patron.",
        "Player: Sibyl drowned in Lake Galakrond",
        "Player: Fail",
        "No...[p/] The Patron must have known that they couldn't physically harm Sibyl.",
        "But they needed to murder her quickly before the Kingsguard realized what was going on.",
        "Tyrion: Sibyl suffocated when Aria threw her into Lake Galakrond.",
        "Tyrion: Her [b]Stone Skin[b/] lessened the impact of the fall.[p/] But it also made her drop like a literal rock.",
        "Tyrion: Aria's [b]Hold Creature[/b] spell prevented her from moving or releasing her spell.",
        "Tyrion: She was helpless as she sank to the bottom of the lake!",
        "Rath: I believe that covers all three of the murders then.",
        "Lucio: Yes...",
        "Lucio: Lord von Sanctus suffocated to death in his own [b]Force Cage[/b].",
        "Lucio: Lady Sibyl drowned after Aria cast [b]Hold Creature[/b] on her.",
        "Lucio: And Lord Pierce died after being wounded by a blade created with [b]Shape Liquid[/b].",
        "Rath: Hm...",
        "Rath: The only common thread I see is that the Patron used some of the victims' magics against them.",
        "...But how does that connect to Pierce?",
        "Did he cast [b]Shape Liquid[/b] to make a blade to defend himself?",
        "Maybe the murderer took it from him and used it against him.",
        "...No.[p/] But he was knocked unconscious alongside you.",
        "He [i]couldn't[/i] have been the one to create that blade.",
        "Tyrion: ...Anyways,[p/] whoever did this had an in-depth knowledge of each of the spells they used to defend themselves.",
        "Tyrion: They knew that Von Sanctus couldn't dispel his own [b]Force Cage[/b].",
        "Tyrion: And they also knew that he still needed oxygen from within it.",
        "Tyrion: And in Sibyl's case,[p/] they knew Aria couldn't physically harm her once she had [b]Stone Skin[/b] active.",
        "Lucio: They also knew that [b]Hold Creature[/b] would prevent Sibyl from [i]dispelling[/i] her own [b]Stone Skin[/b].",
        "Tyrion: Not only that.[p/] They did all of this in a quick time frame.",
        "Tyrion: Von Sanctus and Sibyl died within thirteen minutes of each other.",
        "Tyrion: And if Aria hadn't encountered Celeste,[p/] Pierce might've died [i]just[/i] as quickly.",
        "Rath: So whoever did this had an in-depth knowledge of high-level magic.",
        "Lucio: Not only that...[p/] They came up with creative ways to bypass the defenses put up by von Sanctus and Sibyl.",
        "Rath: Yes...[p/] They had the ability to react quickly and decisively.",
        "Lucio: *sigh*[p/] But considering the circumstances...[p/] that [i]hardly[/i] narrows it down.",
        "Lucio: Several members of the Four Pillar Families were present that day.",
        "Lucio: Each and every one of them studied at the Imperial Academy.",
        "Lucio: They would all be knowledgeable in magic and its applications.",
        "Something they're saying isn't sitting right by you for some reason.",
        "There's [i]something[/i] there.[p/] So why can't you see it?",
        "...",
        "Ugh...[p/] It's no use.[p/] You just can't piece it together yet.",
        "...But you're not finished yet.",
        "Tyrion: There's another angle to this.",
        "Tyrion: Consider [i]who[/i] the Patron did and [i]didn't[/i] target.",
        "Tyrion: The victims were Lloyd von Sanctus,[p/] Coraline Sibyl,[p/] and Garrick Pierce.",
        "Tyrion: What's a similarity that we can draw between at least two of them?",
        "Player: Von Sanctus and Sibyl are House leaders of Pillar Families|Sibyl and von Sanctus are House leaders of Pillar Families",
        "Player: Fail",
        "No...[p/] The victims were von Sanctus,[p/] Sibyl,[p/] and Pierce.",
        "It doesn't quite work for all three of them.",
        "But there is a common thread between at least two of them.",
        "Tyrion: Von Sanctus and Sibyl were the heads of their respective noble houses.",
        "Rath: Are you saying the Patron's goal was to assassinate leaders of the Four Pillars?",
        "Tyrion: That's the motive that makes the most sense.",
        "Tyrion: ...But that [i]does[/i] leave one question.",
        "Lucio: ...",
        "Lucio: Don't be coy.[p/] I'm not [i]daft[/i], Cuthbert.",
        "Tyrion: Actually,[p/] I [i]highly[/i] doubt it was you.",
        "Lucio: ...Really, now?",
        "Tyrion: Out of most of the people there,[p/] you could have easily tricked your daughter into signing a Blood Contract.",
        "Tyrion: But [i]why[/i] would you need to do that?",
        "Tyrion: You're the Grand General of Wyverngarde's military,[p/] and the Cathedral was [i]filled[/i] with your men.",
        "Tyrion: You could have easily equipped one of your best mages to carry out this massacre.",
        "Tyrion: And you wouldn't even [i]need[/i] to make a deal with a demon to do so.",
        "Rath: So why [i]wasn't[/i] Lucio targeted then?",
        "Tyrion: From her encounter with Celeste,[p/] it's clear there's a limit to Aria's combat capabilities.",
        "Tyrion: The Patron might've simply doubted Aria's ability to defeat the Grand General.",
        "Tyrion: But there's also another explanation.",
        "Player: The Patron wanted to frame House Steelwind for the murders",
        "Player: Fail",
        "No...[p/] The Patron made no attempt to kill Lucio Steelwind.",
        "And when they were controlling Aria,[p/] they didn't make any attempt to hide her actions.",
        "They [i]wanted[/i] people to see her.",
        "Tyrion: The Patron [i]wanted[/i] people to suspect House Steelwind for the murders.",
        "Tyrion: They used Lucio Steelwind's daughter to commit the crime.",
        "Tyrion: Then they intentionally left him alive to cast suspicion on him.",
        "Lucio: ...[i]That's[/i] why they used my daughter?",
        "...Is that a tinge of anger you feel from him?",
        "Tyrion: ...Anyways,[p/] [i]that[/i] leads me to my next point.",
        "Tyrion: Imagine if we never discovered Aria's Blood Contract with the Empress of Discord.",
        "Tyrion: What would have happened?",
        "Rath: ...We'd still think that Ms. Steelwind succumbed to Mageblight.",
        "Rath: She would have been convicted for the murders,[p/] and trust in House Steelwind would be forever diminished.",
        "Tyrion: About a month ago,[p/] House Frega lost its head.",
        "Tyrion: And his successor:[p/] Laefe Frega,[p/] was woefully unprepared to take his place.",
        "Tyrion: [i]Now[/i], the heads of House von Sanctus and House Sibyl are dead.",
        "Tyrion: ...With House Steelwind being held responsible for it all.",
        "Rath: All Four of the Pillar families would have been weakened as a result of the massacre...",
        "Tyrion: But I think there's another layer to this.",
        "Tyrion: Everything fits together if we assume that the Patron's goal was to weaken the Pillar Families.",
        "Tyrion: ...[i]Except[/i] for the murder of Garrick Pierce.",
        "Lucio: Yes...[p/] In contrast to Sibyl and von Sanctus,[p/] Pierce's political power pales in comparison.",
        "Tyrion: Furthermore,[p/] Pierce was already scheduled to be executed next month for the murder of Flinhart McCoy.",
        "Tyrion: Why would the Patron go to the trouble of murdering a condemned man?",
        "Player: Pierce knew the identity of Celeste's parents",
        "Player: Fail",
        "No...[p/] Pierce was [i]going[/i] to die regardless of what the Patron did.",
        "But there [i]has[/i] to be something Pierce did recently.",
        "Something that made the Patron decide to murder him as soon as possible.",
        "Tyrion: The Patron murdered Pierce because they [i]needed[/i] him to die as quickly as possible.",
        "Tyrion: Pierce [i]knew[/i] the identity of Celeste's biological parents.",
        "Celeste: ...My parents?",
        "Tyrion: Do you remember what Pierce said when we showed up for the meeting?",
        "Garrick: Ah...[p/] You've finally arrived...",
        "Garrick: I suppose this means you've finally decided-",
        "Garrick: Wait...[p/][s/] [i]You[/i] two?",
        "Celeste: We got your letter.",
        "Garrick: Letter?[p/][s/] What letter?!",
        "Tyrion: You...[p/] sent us a letter, Pierce.",
        "Tyrion: It said that you knew who Celeste's parents were.",
        "Garrick: I [i]did[/i] send that letter,[p/] but not to [i]you[/i] two.",
        "Tyrion: We weren't the intended recipients of that letter.",
        "Celeste: ...That's right!",
        "Tyrion: So [i]that[/i] leaves one last question.",
        "Player: The Patron",
        "Player: Fail",
        "No...[p/] You have a feeling that Pierce sent that letter to someone closely tied to this case.",
        "There's only one person he could have sent it to.",
        "Tyrion: There's only one person Pierce could have sent that letter to.",
        "Tyrion: The person who orchestrated the massacre in the first place![p/][s/] The Patron!",
        "Lucio: But that means-!",
        "Tyrion: The Patron is someone who would be threatened by Celeste's parentage!",
        "Rath: Order![p/][s/] Order in the court!",
        "Celeste: But...[p/] I don't understand.",
        "Tyrion: I'm sorry.[p/] I know this is a lot to take in.",
        "Tyrion: But I think they were targeting you for some reason.",
        "Tyrion: Pierce knew the identity of Celeste's parents and attempted to blackmail the Patron with this.",
        "Tyrion: Instead of complying with Pierce's demands,[p/] the Patron instead sent the letter to me.",
        "Lucio: But why go to the trouble of luring [i]you[/i] there?!",
        "Lucio: They could have just allowed Pierce to wait in the Prayer room while the defendant made her way to murder him.",
        "Tyrion: Looking back on it,[p/] it's possible they wanted to kill Celeste too.",
        "Celeste: ...What?",
        "Tyrion: They knew I wouldn't meet with Pierce alone.[p/] And the information he had was about [i]her[/i].",
        "Tyrion: The Patron correctly guessed that I'd bring her with me.",
        "Tyrion: By killing both Pierce and Celeste,[p/] they'd eliminate any threat Celeste would pose to them.",
        "Celeste: ...",
        "Rath: ...But who would be threatened by such information?",
        "Lucio: The mere [i]existence[/i] of McCoy posed a threat to them...",
        "Lucio: It must have [i]something[/i] to do with her birthright.",
        "Tyrion: Right...",
        "Tyrion: So who would that leave?",
        "The Royal Family",
        "Tyrion: ...King de Wyverngarde just recently died.",
        "Tyrion: What if Celeste was a member of the royal family?",
        "Celeste: ...You think I'm a princess?!",
        "Tyrion: I don't want to suspect Aster.[p/] But we [i]need[/i] to consider every possibility.",
        "Tyrion: And when it comes to conflicts of inheritance,[p/] a royal line of succession is the first thing that comes to mind.",
        "Tyrion: Not only that,[p/] the King would have the authority to pardon Pierce for his crimes.",
        "Lucio: But that wouldn't entirely make sense.",
        "Tyrion: What do you mean?",
        "Lucio: If McCoy was abandoned at a tavern in Kornhaven,[p/] we must assume she's a bastard child.",
        "Celeste: Okay...[p/] I don't know why you have to bring [i]that[/i] up.",
        "Lucio: ...My [i]point[/i] is that King Olivier wouldn't abandon a child of pure royal blood.",
        "Lucio: The kingdom requires heirs to continue the royal bloodline.",
        "Lucio: He would've leveraged her in a diplomatic marriage.",
        "Tyrion: ...That's disgusting.",
        "Lucio: That's diplomacy, Cuthbert.",
        "Lucio: Anyways,[p/] even if McCoy was of royal blood,[p/] Aster is the King's eldest child.",
        "Lucio: And he's of [i]pure[/i] royal blood.",
        "Lucio: McCoy would have no claim to the throne under these circumstances.",
        "Tyrion: Right...[p/] I see what you mean.",
        "Tyrion: I suppose that eliminates Aster for now.",
        "House Frega",
        "Tyrion: I recall during Beatrice Frega's trial,[p/] we heard William Frega's last will and testament.",
        "Tyrion: It mentioned that House Frega's assets would be divided evenly between [i]all[/i] of his children.",
        "Lucio: Ah...[p/] If McCoy were to be revealed as a Frega,[p/] his daughters would be legally obligated to share the estate with her.",
        "Celeste: ...Could I seriously be a Frega?",
        "Tyrion: I don't want to suspect Laefe or Miriam.[p/] But we [i]need[/i] to consider every possibility.",
        "Tyrion: And as we've seen,[p/] the Fregas are no strangers to making deals with demons.",
        "Tyrion: But,[p/] it still doesn't quite fit.[p/] I doubt Laefe or Miriam would do something like this.",
        "Rath: ...What are you basing that on?",
        "Tyrion: I tend to be a good judge of character.[p/] And they just don't seem like the type to do something like this.",
        "Lucio: Bah![p/] You're far too trusting.",
        "Lucio: I hold no doubt that [i]any[/i] of William's children would be capable of something like this.",
        "Tyrion: ...I suppose we'll have to see.",
        "House Steelwind",
        "Tyrion: ...As much as I have my doubts,[p/] House Steelwind [i]is[/i] the only Pillar Family whose House leader survived the past month.",
        "Lucio: ...You think [i]I'm[/i] McCoy's biological father?",
        "Celeste: Ugh...[p/] You're barely a father to your [i]actual[/i] daughter.",
        "Tyrion: I'm only stating that possibility for the sake of argument.",
        "Tyrion: As I've said,[p/] it wouldn't make sense for you to frame your own daughter when [i]House Steelwind[/i] would be blamed.",
        "Tyrion: But we need to consider every possibility.",
        "The Eyetaker",
        "Tyrion: ...What if the Eyetaker orchestrated this whole thing?",
        "Lucio: The Eyetaker?[p/] That common criminal?",
        "Lucio: What reason would [i]he[/i] have to do this?",
        "Tyrion: I've heard firsthand that he was planning to expand his influence throughout Wyverngarde.",
        "Tyrion: He was actually plotting with Beatrice to use House Frega to do so.",
        "Tyrion: Since I ruined his original plans,[p/] setting up that massacre might've been his backup plan.",
        "Tyrion: Perhaps we're looking at this all wrong.",
        "Tyrion: What if Celeste was a part of the royal family and they were planning to use her to take the throne?",
        "Lucio: But if he wanted to do so,[p/] why would he put McCoy in danger by having my daughter attack her?",
        "Lucio: Not only that.[p/] He also had the perfect opportunity to murder His Majesty.",
        "Lucio: Imagine if he had placed a more lethal contingent spell in that [b]Glyph of Contingency[/b].",
        "Lucio: His Majesty might have very well died alongside von Sanctus, Sibyl, and Pierce.",
        "Tyrion: Yeah...[p/] I suppose you're right.",
        "Tyrion: But we need to consider every possibility.",
        "Tyrion: Anyways,[p/] we should consider the other suspects first.",
        "Tyrion: Ugh...[p/] But I can't think of anyone else.",
        "Lucio: Yes.[p/] There's a flaw with each suspect.",
        "Lucio: Your logic is clearly flawed.",
        "Well, you don't see [i]him[/i] coming up with any ideas...",
        "Tyrion: ...",
        "Tyrion: ...There's [i]something[/i] here I'm not seeing.",
        "Tyrion: But I [i]know[/i] I'm close.",
        "Tyrion: There's a missing piece that ties this all together.",
        "Lucio: ...Regardless,[p/] we still have no idea who this \"Empress of Discord\" is.",
        "Lucio: I am loathe to allow such an individual to walk freely through Wyverngarde.",
        "Tyrion: Your Grace.[p/] You've been alive since the creation of Wyverngarde and magic.",
        "Tyrion: Do you know who this demon is?",
        "Rath: I can't say I do...",
        "Rath: Demons tend to take on many titles over their lifetimes.",
        "Rath: ...But whoever this Empress is,[p/] they are brave to so blatantly encroach on my domain like this.",
        "Tyrion: ...Well,[p/] I suppose we'll just have to cross that bridge when we get there.",
        "Rath: We've obtained a lot of information today.[p/] But we clearly have many questions that need to be answered.",
        "Rath: How should we proceed?",
        "Tyrion: ...Ugh.",
        "Rath: ...What is it, Mr. Cuthbert?",
        "Tyrion: I can't help but feel that there's something here I'm not seeing.",
        "Tyrion: I just can't put my finger on it.",
        "Rath: We [i]have[/i] been working at this for quite a while.",
        "Rath: Perhaps we should suspend proceedings so that we can look into these new leads.",
        "Lucio: Hmph...[p/] I have no objections.",
        "Lucio: It would give [i]my[/i] men some time to look into what we've discovered today.",
        "Rath: Then it's settled.",
        "Rath: We'll be postponing proceedings for now.",
        "Rath: But you'll all be expected to return here by tomorrow morning.",
        "Lucio: You are all free to return to your homes for the time being.",
        "Lucio: But make no mistake!",
        "Lucio: The Kingsguard [i]will[/i] be keeping careful watch over [i]all[/i] of you.",
        "There's still this constant nagging sensation in the back of your mind.",
        "Celeste: Hey...[p/] Tyrion?",
        "It's as if you've forgotten something extremely important.",
        "Celeste: ...Tyrion?",

        "Tyrion: I was just thinking about everything.",
        "Celeste: You're looking really stressed out.[p/] Do you want to head back to your house to rest?",
        "Tyrion: No...[p/] We only have a day until the trial resumes.",
        "Tyrion: If we can't figure out what happened after tomorrow,[p/] the magical traces will dissipate.",
        "Celeste: But you already [i]know[/i] what happened,[p/] you just don't know who did it.",
        "Tyrion: Yeah...[p/] But we should speak with the suspects again.",
        "Tyrion: Maybe if I get lucky,[p/] I'll see something through the Eye of Horus.",
        "Celeste: But one of the suspects is the Eyetaker...",
        "Celeste: What are you going to do about him?",
        "Tyrion: ...I suppose I'll have to speak with him too.",
        "Celeste: What?![p/][s/] No!",
        "Celeste: What if he tries to kill you again?!",
        "Tyrion: Aria's life is on the line.",
        "Tyrion: That's just a risk I'll have to take.",
        "Celeste: T-[p/][s/]Tyrion...[p/] Do you even understand what you've been pulled into?",
        "Tyrion: ...What?",
        "Celeste: Someone just murdered a bunch of nobles,[p/] and they even attacked members of the royal family.",
        "Celeste: Now there are Ancient Dragons and Demon Lords involved too.",
        "Celeste: Isn't this above your pay grade?",

        "Celeste: It's not, though!",
        "Celeste: What if the Empress of Discord attacks you?!",
        "Celeste: What if the Patron decides that you're getting too close to the truth?!",

        "Tyrion: ...And what if it's not enough?",
        "Celeste: I...",
        "Tyrion: I'm not so arrogant that I think they can't do it without me.",
        "Tyrion: But what if they [i]can't[/i] figure out who the Patron is?",
        "Tyrion: Aria will spend the rest of her life in prison.",
        "Tyrion: What if I could have done something to prevent that?",
        "Celeste: I...",
        "Celeste: I don't care if that happens...",
        "Tyrion: Celeste!",
        "Celeste: I don't care, Tyrion!",
        "Celeste: I'll apologize to her all you want after this!",
        "Celeste: But all I want is to keep you safe!",
        "Celeste: ...And I don't know if I'm able to do that anymore.",
        "Even [i]she[/i] seems surprised by what she said...",
        "Celeste: ...I-[p/][s/]I'm sorry.[p/] I didn't mean to-",
        "Tyrion: ...",
        "Tyrion: I'm really happy you're a part of my life.",
        "Celeste: ...W-[p/][s/]What?!",
        "Tyrion: I know what you're saying is coming from a place of care.",
        "Tyrion: And I'm really sorry about how much I've been worrying you lately, but...",
        "Celeste: ...You're not going to stop, are you?",
        "Tyrion: It's like I've always said...",
        "Celeste: *sigh*[p/] Man,[p/] king,[p/] or god.[p/] Nothing will stop you from getting justice for your clients.",
        "Celeste: ...",
        "Celeste: I'm going to talk to Lucio.",
        "Tyrion: What?",
        "Celeste: If we're going to meet the Eyetaker again,[p/] we're bringing some knights with us.",
        "Tyrion: Celeste...[p/] That's hardly-",
        "Celeste: Nope![p/][s/] You don't get a say in this!",
        "Celeste: And if you're not here when I get back,[p/] I [i]will[/i] find you.",
        "Judging from her expression,[p/] it's not an empty threat.",

        "She might have a point though...",
        "Before everything happened,[p/] you weren't even sure if you [i]wanted[/i] to continue being an attorney.",

        "Wait...[p/][s/] What?!",
        "Celeste: Alright.[p/] Lucio's cleared it.",
        "Celeste: It was surprisingly easy to convince him.",

        "Tyrion: I-[p/][s/]I'm fine...[p/] Let's not waste any more time.",
        "Before she has a chance to respond,[p/] you hastily walk past her.",
        "Celeste: Hey![p/][s/] Don't walk so far ahead!",
        "You need to stay focused on the trial for Aria's sake.",
        "But when this is all over, you'll...",
        "...",
        "W-[p/][s/]Well...[p/] You suppose you don't have to think about that until then.",
        "Rath: ...",
        "Eris: Hello, your lordship.[p/] I think this is the first time we've met.",
        "Eris: ...You're a lot smaller than I expected.",
        "Rath: ...",
        "Gallery: Who is this woman?!",
        "Gallery: Why have they brought a [i]civilian[/i] before the Scaled Lord?",
        "Tyrion: People of the court.[p/] Thank you for your patience.",
        "Tyrion: Until now,[p/] we've known this woman as Eris Illmater.",
        "Tyrion: And ever since the massacre,[p/] we've been trying to determine [i]who[/i] orchestrated this.",
        "Tyrion: We only knew that Aria Steelwind signed a Blood Contract with a demon called \"the Empress of Discord\".",
        "Tyrion: We still knew very little about this demon.",
        "Tyrion: We had no idea who they were or what they even looked like.",
        "Tyrion: But we know the truth now.",
        "Tyrion: People of the Wyverngarde nobility.[p/] The woman on the witness stand [i]isn't[/i] a civilian.",
        "Tyrion: She is the demon known as the Empress of Discord!",
        "Tyrion: I have no idea [i]how[/i].[p/] But her form is that of a human.",
        "Tyrion: Using this disguise,[p/] she entered the Grand Cathedral posing as Beatrice Frega's guide.",
        "Tyrion: She then aided the Patron by using Beatrice Frega to help Aria Steelwind massacre members of the nobility.",
        "Lucio: Why are we continuing with this?",
        "Lucio: She's already admitted to taking part in the massacre!",
        "Lucio: Let's force her to tell us who the Patron is and be done with this!",
        "Eris: Ah,[p/] how typical.",
        "Eris: The Grand General thinks he can solve [i]all[/i] of his problems with violence.",
        "Eris: But let me ask you this.[p/] Why are you assuming that the Patron is a human?",
        "Tyrion: ...What?",
        "Eris: In Aria's Contract,[p/] it says that \"the Patron\" is the individual who [i]gives[/i] the Contract to her.",
        "Eris: How do you know that [i]I'm[/i] not that individual?",
        "Eris: I go by many names.[p/] The \"Empress of Discord\" is only one of them.",
        "Lucio: Hmph...[p/] If what you're saying is true,[p/] that makes this a simpler matter.",
        "Lucio: We simply need to execute [i]you[/i] for your crimes against the kingdom.",
        "Eris: Haven't you forgotten what my underling said during Frega's trial?",
        "Eris: As a demon,[p/] I can never truly die.",
        "Eris: If you destroy my body,[p/] I'll simply reform in the Abyssal Hells.",
        "Eris: I wonder...[p/] What might happen to your daughter if you were to draw my ire?",
        "Lucio: ...!",
        "Eris: You're prosecuting her and playing the villain.",
        "Eris: But I know the truth.[p/] You secretly care about her, don't you?",
        "Lucio: ...W-[p/][s/]What nonsense are you spouting?",
        "Eris: When you thought she had Mageblight,[p/] you [i]had[/i] to prosecute her.",
        "Eris: You held onto the little hope that you could convict her and convince her to take a plea deal.",
        "Eris: As the king's wife,[p/] her position [i]might[/i] have been salvageable.",
        "Eris: ...And you did this all so she could be with her [i]beloved[/i] Aster.",
        "Tyrion: ...What?",
        "Lucio: I-[p/][s/]I...",
        "Eris: But then it was revealed she signed a Blood Contract with me.",
        "Eris: [i]That[/i] changed everything.",
        "Eris: Mageblight is one thing.[p/] But a demon owning her soul?",
        "Eris: She can't very well be a queen like this,[p/] now can she?",
        "Eris: You [i]had[/i] to find out who the \"Patron\" was before her trial ended.[p/] Didn't you, Lucio?",
        "Eris: Otherwise,[p/] your beloved daughter would [i]never[/i] be free.",
        "Lucio: ...",
        "Eris: And you did [i]all[/i] of this because you feel [i]bad[/i] for what you did to her.",
        "Lucio: ...[i]Everything[/i] I've done is for the good of House Steelwind.",
        "Eris: Ah,[p/] is [i]that[/i] what you were doing?",
        "Eris: Because the way I see it,[p/] you abandoned her for her entire childhood.",
        "Eris: You felt so guilty about killing her mother,[p/] that you couldn't [i]bear[/i] to face her.",
        "Lucio: N-[p/][s/]No...[p/][s/] I-",
        "Tyrion: ...Eris.[p/] Stop this.",
        "Eris: And you [i]know[/i] what that did to her.",
        "Eris: You didn't [i]just[/i] take away her mother.[p/] You took away her father too.",
        "Eris: You starved her of any affection.",
        "Eris: She couldn't help but latch onto the [i]first[/i] person to show her any kind of superficial kindness.",
        "Tyrion: Eris!",
        "Eris: She didn't fall in love with Aster.[p/] She became [i]obsessed[/i] with him.",
        "Eris: She stopped being her own person.[p/] And she clings to him like a parasite.",
        "Eris: She changed [i]everything[/i] about herself to suit his likes and desires.",
        "Eris: And you know deep down in your heart...[p/] You know that if he is [i]ever[/i] taken away from her,[p/] she [i]will[/i] fall apart.",
        "Lucio: ...",
        "Eris: Since I pity you so much,[p/] I'll let you in on a little secret.",
        "Eris: Killing me won't save your daughter.[p/] And you [i]don't[/i] have the means to confine me.",
        "Eris: And even if you know who I am,[p/] your daughter will [i]never[/i] be safe from my influence.",
        "Lucio: ...What?",
        "Eris: But I suppose there's [i]one[/i] possible way to break my Contract.",
        "Lucio: W-[p/][s/]What?![p/][s/] What is it?!",
        "Eris: My Contract \"will bind Aria Steelwind to the Patron so long as they [i]both[/i] live.”",
        "Eris: If you truly want to free your daughter from my control,[p/] all you have to do is [i]kill[/i] her.",
        "Eris: Do the poor thing a favor and put her out of her misery.",
        "Lucio: You [i]little[/i] wretch![p/][s/] I will hunt you until the end of-!",
        "Rath: Enough!",
        "Rath: Lucio...[p/] We cannot antagonize her if we want to find out [i]how[/i] this happened...",
        "Lucio: ...",
        "Is she right...?[p/] Is Aria's fate truly doomed?",
        "There has to be [i]something[/i] you can do.",
        "Tyrion: ...I just don't understand, Eris.",
        "Tyrion: Why are you doing this?",
        "Tyrion: You're not a noble...[p/] You're probably not even a citizen of Wyverngarde.",
        "Tyrion: Why would you go through the trouble of doing [i]any[/i] of this?!",
        "Eris: ...Tyrion.[p/] Why are [i]you[/i] here?",
        "Tyrion: ...What?",
        "Eris: Why do you constantly risk your life for the sake of others?",
        "Eris: Why do you try to seek justice in a [i]clearly[/i] unjust world?",
        "Tyrion: ...I don't know, honestly.",
        "Eris: I think you [i]do[/i] know.",
        "Eris: The answer is simple.[p/] You do it because it satisfies you.",
        "Eris: You save people.[p/] You \"fight\" the system.",
        "Eris: You just love indulging in your own heroics, don't you?",
        "Celeste: That's not-!",
        "Eris: It feels good, doesn't it Tyrion?",
        "Eris: You know that you're the only righteous person in an unjust society.",
        "Eris: When you succeed,[p/] you're hailed as a hero.",
        "Eris: And if you fail,[p/] it's society's fault,[p/] not yours.",
        "Eris: No matter what happens,[p/] you can take solace in the knowledge that you're so much [i]better[/i] than everyone else.",
        "Eris: That superiority you feel over them must be intoxicating.",
        "Eris: Your divine blood makes it so.[p/] You just can't resist giving in to it.",
        "Tyrion: ...",
        "Eris: But just as your divine blood compels you to do good,[p/] [i]my[/i] hellish blood compels me to do the opposite.",
        "Eris: I just can't [i]help[/i] but take every opportunity to make you all suffer.",
        "Eris: My entire [i]purpose[/i] is to see each and every one of their faces contorted in agony and despair.",
        "Eris: ...Humanity is a stain on the world.",
        "Eris: They're worthless parasites who steal,[p/] maim,[p/] and kill to get what they want.",
        "Eris: That's all they are.[p/] And I [i]despise[/i] those who try to pretend that they're [i]anything[/i] different.",
        "Tyrion: ...",
        "Tyrion: You're wrong, Eris.[p/] Humanity is so much more than you realize.",
        "Tyrion: ...And I truly pity you if that's all you see in us.",
        "Eris: Oh,[p/] so now it's \"us\".",
        "Eris: That actually just reminded me,[p/] there's something I hate even more than humanity...",
        "Eris: I [i]despise[/i] the celestials of the Upper Planes who go against the natural order.",
        "Eris: They condemn and admonish beings like me,[p/] all while watching humanity suffer from their secluded little heaven.",
        "Eris: They realized that humanity would never [i]willingly[/i] choose good over evil.",
        "Eris: So they created the heavensborn to tip the balance in their favor.",
        "Eris: It's so self-indulgent that it makes me want to puke.",
        "Tyrion: ...[i]That's[/i] what the heavensborn are?",
        "Eris: It is.[p/] And I've made quite a hobby out of breaking them and sending them back to their creators.",
        "Eris: I throw them into the deepest pit of despair before extinguishing their lives.",
        "Eris: There's been no greater joy in my eternal life.",
        "Eris: ...And it took a lot of work to get [i]you[/i] right where I need you, Tyrion.",
        "Tyrion: Wait...[p/] Are you saying-?",
        "Eris: You asked me why I did this, didn't you?",
        "Eris: My actions that day were all for you, my dearest Tyrion.",
        "Eris: All so I could see the despair on your face when you realized the [i]truth[/i].",
        "Celeste: Tyrion...",
        "Tyrion: N-[p/][s/]No...",
        "Lucio: That's enough out of you, you witch.",
        "Tyrion: L-[p/][s/]Lucio...?",
        "Lucio: Cuthbert![p/][s/] You [i]promised[/i] me that we would save my daughter together!",
        "Tyrion: I-[p/][s/]I'm sorry...[p/] I-",
        "Lucio: You said those words to me with such conviction.",
        "Lucio: Yet here you stand...[p/] quivering like a grunt in his first battle.",
        "Tyrion: ...",
        "Lucio: Are a few meager doubts enough to force a retreat from you?",
        "Lucio: Is [i]that[/i] all it takes to defeat the infamous Tyrion Cuthbert?",
        "Tyrion: ...",
        "...He's probably desperate at this point.",
        "If Eris is the Patron,[p/] there's very little hope for Aria.",
        "Unlike Beatrice's,[p/] her Blood Contract was short and concise.",
        "There was very little room for interpretation.[p/] So you probably can't dispute it either.",

        "No...[p/][s/] What kind of [i]friend[/i] would you be if you didn't see this through?",
        "Tyrion: ...Eris.[p/] We didn't call you here today to wax poetic with you.",
        "Tyrion: The people you've harmed have a right to know what you did that day.",
        "Tyrion: So either give us your testimony or [i]get out[/i].",
        "Eris: Even now,[p/] you're still undeterred.[p/] I really [i]do[/i] love that about you.",
        "Eris: ...But I do wonder how long that will last.",
        "Eris: It's true.[p/] I was the one who masterminded this.",
        "Eris: I knew about the King's funeral at the Grand Cathedral.[p/] So I forced Beatrice Frega to allow me to accompany her.",
        "Eris: When I was there,[p/] I used my Contracts with Beatrice Frega and Aria Steelwind to compel them to act against their will.",
        "Eris: And through the actions of Beatrice Frega and Aria Steelwind,[p/] I facilitated the deaths of Lloyd von Sanctus,[p/] Coraline Sibyl,[p/] and Garrick Pierce.",
        "Eris: The only motivation for my actions that day was to harm Tyrion Cuthbert's friends and make him suffer.",
        "Eris: And before you ask...[p/] Aside from my thralls,[p/] I was acting alone that day.[p/] I didn't follow direct [i]or[/i] indirect orders from anyone.",
        "Tyrion: Your testimony is pretty...[p/] thorough.",
        "Eris: Of course.[p/] I [i]am[/i] a demon after all.",
        "Eris: Since I'm unable to lie,[p/] I thought it would be best to be as detailed as possible.",
        "Eris: That way,[p/] there's no room for doubt.",
        "Eris: Isn't that wonderful, Tyrion?",
        "Ugh...[p/] She's definitely playing with you.",
        "She may not have [i]technically[/i] lied.[p/] But she's definitely not acting in good faith.",
        "You should look at her testimony more closely.",
        "Eris: It's true.[p/] I was the one who masterminded this.",
        "Tyrion: So you completely carried out this plan yourself.",
        "Eris: Well,[p/] I clearly had the help of Beatrice Frega and Aria Steelwind.",
        "Eris: So I wasn't [i]truly[/i] acting alone.",
        "Tyrion: You know what I meant.",
        "Eris: Yes, yes.[p/] I just can't help myself sometimes.",
        "Eris: To state things plainly,[p/] no human [i]willingly[/i] helped me with my plan that day.",
        "You know that she [i]can't[/i] lie.",
        "But she's probably had a lot of practice deceiving people.",
        "You should keep your wits about you.",

        "Until you can extract all of the information she has,[p/] you'll just have to play along with her games.",
        "Eris: When I was there,[p/] I used my Contracts with Beatrice Frega and Aria Steelwind to compel them to act against their will.",
        "Tyrion: What a terrifying ability...",
        "Eris: Thank you for noticing.",
        "Tyrion: That...[p/] wasn't a compliment.",
        "Tyrion: ...I find it all quite sickening how you demons prey on people.",

        "Eris: W-[p/][s/]Wait...[p/] You know I can't speak lies, correct?!",
        "Tyrion: By the Eye of Horus,[p/][s/] I demand the opportunity to dispute Celeste McCoy's Blood Contract!",
        "Eris: I-[p/][s/]I'll state it plainly, then![p/][s/] There will be no room for doubt!",
        "Tyrion: ...I don't care.",
        "Eris: What?!",

        "Tyrion: How could I ever face her again if I didn't do the same for her?",

        "Celeste: A few minutes after Pierce died,[p/] Aster,[p/] the Inquisition,[p/] and the Kingsguard showed up to arrest Aria.",
        "Lucio: Aside from your conversation with Illmater...[p/] That seems to match up with what we already knew.",
        "Rath: Hm...[p/] It appears we'll simply need to wait for Celeste's memories to return.",

        "Celeste: I think I remember now.[p/] We went to meet with Pierce at 1:50 PM.[p/] And we heard that commotion outside at 2:20 PM.",
        "Tyrion: Right...[p/] We now know for certain that the meeting [i]was[/i] at 2:00 PM.",
        "Celeste: Yeah...[p/] She only changed my memories so she could trick all of us.",
        "Tyrion: Considering that [i]my[/i] memories were intact,[p/] she must have not had the power to change them.",
        "Lucio: Yes...[p/] She never actually used her demonic powers to revive you.",
        "Lucio: She merely had Beatrice release the [b]Feign Death[/b] spell that [i]she[/i] originally cast.",
        "Celeste: ...I still can't believe I fell for that.",
        "Tyrion: Anyways...[p/] Who did you see attacking the guards?[p/] Was it Aria or Beatrice?",

        "Tyrion: So we [i]weren't[/i] wrong about Beatrice sneaking past you during your fight.",
        "Celeste: Yeah...[p/] Now that I look back on it,[p/] it was probably a distraction so Beatrice could sneak past me.",
        "Tyrion: Hm...",
        "Lucio: What is it, Cuthbert?",
        "Tyrion: If the Patron was working [i]together[/i] with Eris,[p/] why would Eris use Beatrice to knock out Aria?",
        "Celeste: I never thought of that...",
        "Lucio: ...Frankly,[p/] I find it hard to believe that the Patron willingly went along with the Empress's convoluted plan.",
        "Lucio: They clearly [i]needed[/i] Pierce to die.[p/] And relying on McCoy to do it seems foolhardy.",
        "Right...[p/] Is it possible that Eris went off-script then?",

        "Celeste: I know...[p/] I was just so scared.",

        "Tyrion: ...I'm glad that you care about me that much.",
        "Tyrion: ...But what you did almost destroyed Aria's future.",

        "Lucio: My men [i]all[/i] reported that His Majesty led them to the Prayer Room [i]after[/i] he exited the [b]Force Cage[/b].",

        "Lucio: What?!",

        "Tyrion: And if these Contracts were structured similarly to Celeste's,[p/] she must have had the ability to manipulate their memories.",

        "Tyrion: I'm not trying to imply anything.[p/] I'm just stating the facts that we know.",
        "Tyrion: We know that a human,[p/] whether willingly or otherwise,[p/] worked with the Empress of Discord to orchestrate this massacre.",
        "Tyrion: He was deeply trusted by Aria Steelwind.",
        "Tyrion: So much so that she didn't even think [i]twice[/i] about signing a Contract that he gave her.",

        "Rath: To claim that the king collaborated with a demon in any capacity,[p/] is no small thing.",
        "Tyrion: I do.[p/] But I'm [i]hoping[/i] this is all a misunderstanding.",
        "Tyrion: After all,[p/] Eris’s goal seemed to be nothing beyond sowing as much discord as possible.",
        "Tyrion: She made us believe that Celeste and Aria were [i]both[/i] murderers.",
        "Tyrion: I want to save Aria.[p/] But I also want to believe in the people who've believed in me.",
        "Tyrion: If Aster has information that can save Aria,[p/] we have to find it.",
        "Rath: ...Very well, then.",
        "Rath: I suppose it's only right then,[p/] with everything that has transpired,[p/] that the king should make his truth known.",

        "Tyrion: We can trust her now.",
        "Tyrion: She's no longer under the effects of a Blood Contract.",

        "Aster: I'm sorry, Mr. Cuthbert.[p/] But I suppose what I mean is...",
        "Aster: After everything that just happened,[p/] how can we trust you?",
        "Tyrion: ...What?",
        "Aster: You disappeared for quite some time,[p/] to [i]who knows[/i] where.",
        "Aster: And the only person who was there with you was Celeste and a [i]demon[/i] who can clearly alter people's memories.",
        "Aster: Isn’t it a [i]little[/i] convenient she was burnt to a crisp almost [i]immediately[/i] after your return?",
        "Aster: She said it multiple times.[p/] That didn't [i]actually[/i] kill her.",
        "Tyrion: I-[p/][s/]I...",
        "Aster: And [i]now[/i]...[p/] You're singling me out as The Patron,[p/] the one ultimately responsible for the murders of von Sanctus and Sibyl.",
        "Aster: If that demon made you into her puppet,[p/] wouldn't this be [i]exactly[/i] what she wanted?",
        "Rath: ...",
        "Gallery: ...That's right!",
        "Gallery: How do we know this \"heavensborn\" can be trusted?!",

        "You can feel the room turning against you...",
        "Even the Scaled Lord looks wary...",
        "Aster: S-[p/][s/]Sorry![p/][s/] I didn't mean to insult you after everything you've done.",
        "Aster: But I suppose there's [i]one[/i] way to confirm your theory.",
        "Tyrion: ...And what's that?",
        "Aster: Use your Divine Edict on me.[p/] Just like you've done several times before.",
        "Aster: If I truly [i]was[/i] in league with that demon,[p/] shouldn't I have a Contract with her?",
        "Aster: It will appear.[p/] Even if I was made to forget about it.",
        "Tyrion: ...?!",
        "Celeste: Wait...[p/] That's right!",
        "Celeste: We already tried that before and it didn't work!",
        "Tyrion: ...Which means that he definitely [i]doesn't[/i] have a Contract with her.",
        "Aster: ...Why aren't you doing it?",
        "Tyrion: I...[p/] can't.[p/] I already tried and nothing appeared.",
        "Aster: I see...",
        "Aster: ...",
        "Aster: I'm sorry, Mr. Cuthbert.[p/] I know you care deeply for her.",
        "Aster: But we all saw Celeste's Blood Contract [i]and[/i] we heard her earlier confession.",
        "Aster: Not to mention,[p/] we have no way of knowing whether Celeste is [i]truly[/i] free from Eris's influence.",
        "Aster: If Ms. Steelwind is to be saved,[p/] we all must accept what needs to be done.",
        "Aster: I don't like saying this.[p/] But I think it's time this trial came to its conclusion.[p/] Don't you, Your Grace?",
        "Rath: ...",
        "Damn it...[p/] He's even got the Scaled Lord on his side.",
        "Even if it's against you,[p/] he raised a lot of good points.",
        "But is he acting with malice?[p/] Or is he just being careful?",
        "Celeste: Come on![p/][s/] Think, Tyrion!",
        "Celeste: We just proved my Blood Contract wasn’t valid.",
        "Celeste: But the one who made Aria commit those murders is still out there.",
        "Maybe you’ve been thinking about this the wrong way.",
        "Eris found ways to trick people into signing Blood Contracts before.",
        "So she wouldn’t necessarily [i]need[/i] a Blood Contract to trick Aster into accidentally helping her.",
        "The question isn't whether Aster knowingly did this or not.",
        "The question is...",
        "There had to have been [i]some[/i] sort of physical involvement on his part.",
        "And [i]that[/i] might've left behind evidence that proves it.",
        "Player: Aria was tricked into signing the Blood Contract",
        "Player: Fail",
        "No...[p/] If Aster really [i]is[/i] the Patron,[p/] he could've committed the murders through Aria.",

        "Tyrion: He needed to trick Aria into signing the Contract somehow...",
        "Celeste: ...But you've seen how she is around him.",
        "Celeste: That wouldn't have been very hard to do.",
        "Tyrion: No...[p/] Aria may be extremely lovesick around him,[p/] but she's still an attorney.",
        "Tyrion: She would be careful to read [i]any[/i] contract she signed.",
        "Tyrion: We deduced earlier that her Blood Contract was disguised as a normal legal document.",
        "Tyrion: And I remember something.[p/] When you caught a glimpse of it,[p/] you immediately started teasing her.",

        "Player: Fail",

        "Tyrion: Aster![p/][s/] There is [i]one[/i] piece of physical evidence that proves you were involved in this.",
        "Aster: ...Really?",
        "Tyrion: ...The Patron controlled Aria and committed each of the murders without having to do [i]anything[/i] personally.",
        "Tyrion: But this was all contingent on tricking her into [i]signing[/i] that Contract in the first place.",
        "Tyrion: I recall that you went to a meeting with the High Speaker right [i]before[/i] the massacre started.",
        "Tyrion: It was to discuss your marriage to Aria, wasn't it?",
        "Aster: ...Yes.[p/] That's correct.",
        "Tyrion: Aster,[p/] the Blood Contract that Aria signed needed to [i]look[/i] like a normal legal document.",

        "Tyrion: The language used would've made sense under a [i]different[/i] context.",
        "Tyrion: In that Contract,[p/] Aria gave you her \"mind,[p/] body,[p/] and soul\".",

        "Lucio: [i]Whoever[/i] tricked my daughter would've surely destroyed the evidence by now.",

        "Lucio: I doubt they would've left any copies of the marriage license to be found.",
        "Rath: Indeed.[p/] Bringing such heavy accusations against the High Speaker [i]or[/i] the King will require more than just speculation.",

        "Tyrion: I have more than just speculation, Your Grace.",
        "Tyrion: ...I have a copy of it.",

        "Aster: Y-[p/]Yes...[p/] I'm well aware of them...",
        "Tyrion: ...And did you know Aria took a picture of the marriage license she signed?",
        "Aster: ...What?",

        "Tyrion: So I'll ask you this, Aster.",
        "Tyrion: Who gave that marriage license to her?",

        "Aster: I was only cleaning up the mess [i]you[/i] created!",
        "Aster: ...And if it weren't for Eris's little games,[p/] I would have done it in a much [i]cleaner[/i] manner.",

        "Tyrion: But he wouldn't have had Eris kill Pierce personally if it wasn't important...",
        "Tyrion: He needed both you [i]and[/i] Pierce to die during the massacre.",
        "Tyrion: Which means you two were [i]just[/i] as important targets as von Sanctus and Sibyl.",

        "Celeste: If [i]that[/i] wasn't a problem,[p/] why would he be so scared of Pierce's blackmail?",

        "The Church of Bahamut",

        "Theon: The Church of Bahamut is important not only to Wyverngarde's culture but to its civil stability.",
        "Theon: Faith is a powerful and unifying force.",
        "Tyrion: ...Is that why you revise Wyverngarde's history and keep heavensborn outside the country?",
        "Theon: I don't know [i]what[/i] you're trying to insinuate. [mind=\"Hmph... Dissidents like him will be the end of our culture.\"/]",

        "The Theocracy of Lumina",

        "Tyrion: The theocracy?[p/] Aren't they the nation east of us?",
        "Beatrice: Yes.[p/] The luminites worship the celestial gods,[p/] while [i]our[/i] people worship the ancient dragons.",
        "Beatrice: A few centuries ago,[p/] our nation was locked in a bitter war with the luminites.",
        "Beatrice: Even now,[p/] the crown sees the celestial religions as a threat to our draconic culture.",
        "Beatrice: The church has done its best to wipe out any religions that worship the Celestials.",
        "Hm...[p/] If Aster's actions had anything to do with the Theocracy,[p/] he would've targeted you,[p/] not Celeste.",

        "TYRION: How have I never heard of this before?",
        "ERIS: To be honest,[p/] that law is just a way to revere him and appease the church.",

        "Celeste: They'd definitely betray you the first chance they got.",
        "Harold: Well, legends say that demons often drafted Blood Contracts for this reason.",
        "Tyrion: Wait...[p/] Do you mean like a [i]legally binding[/i] contract?",
        "Harold: The concept is similar.[p/] But once you sign a Blood Contract,[p/] both you and the demon are magically compelled to fulfill its terms.",
        "Harold: It's said that violating its terms will result in instant death for the offender...[p/] No matter who it is.",
        "Tyrion: So I guess there's [i]some[/i] protection...",
        "Harold: Well...[p/] As an attorney,[p/] I'm sure you understand that it's possible to exploit and use loopholes in [i]any[/i] contract.",
        "Harold: And according to the legends,[p/] demons take great pride in their ability to deceive and corrupt people.",
        "Hm...[p/] Aster [i]did[/i] make a deal with the Empress of Discord.",

        "Coraline: House von Sanctus handles commerce,[p/] both local and international.",

        "Coraline: That is correct.",
        "Hm...[p/] With three of the Four Pillar House leaders dead,[p/] very few people will be able to challenge Aster.",
        "And since Aria was framed for it,[p/] House Steelwind will probably lose its influence as well.",

        "Aster: I'd have thought that you two,[p/] out of [s/][i]everyone[/i],[p/] could have understood why I did this.",
        "Tyrion: We [i]know[/i] it's not fair!",
        "Tyrion: But we're capable of [i]changing[/i] it![p/][s/] And you [i]had[/i] the power to do just that!",
        "Aster: I [i]AM[/i] changing it!",
        "Aster: You worked [i]so[/i] hard to find the truth behind von Sanctus and Sibyl’s murders!",
        "Aster: But here’s a little bit of \"truth\" that's evident to [i]everyone[/i] in this room [s/][i]except[/i] you two!",
        "Aster: Half of the people present here today are [i]glad[/i] that they’re gone!",
        "Aster: And the [i]other[/i] half wants to be the ones to replace them!",
        "Aster: The blood I shed in a single hour did more good for this kingdom than you two would have done in years!",
        "Tyrion: So [i]that’s[/i] how you plan on fixing this country’s problems?!",
        "Tyrion: By working with demons and [i]killing[/i] your way to a \"brighter\" future?!",
        "Aster: If I [i]have[/i] to,[p/] why not?!",
        "Aster: Every day,[p/][s/] [i]across[/i] this nation,[p/][s/] commoners are killed and oppressed at the hands of the very nobles gathered here!",
        "Aster: They [i]bleed[/i] this country dry,[p/] and feed on its people like carrion!",
        "Aster: ...I am merely returning a much-needed sense of equality.",
        "Aster: Do you really think [i]any[/i] of you are in a position to judge me?!",
        "Aster: All of you,[p/] who came running at the news of my father’s death?!",
        "Aster: All so you could be the [i]first[/i] to fill my ears with your sycophantic praises!",
        "Aster: Do you know what the difference between the Empress of Discord and all of [i]you[/i] is?![p/][s/] That demon was just a [i]bit[/i] more honest!",
        "Tyrion: Aria [i]wanted[/i] to change that![p/][s/] She would have helped you!",
        "Aster: Aria is too [i]stupid[/i] and too [i]naive[/i] to do [i]anything[/i]!",
        "Celeste: She loved you!",
        "Celeste: How could you-?!",
        "Aster: She loved her [i]idea[/i] of me!",
        "Aster: She loved a [i]weak[/i] and [i]ineffectual[/i] prince,[p/] who would have borne watching his kingdom rot,[p/] with a damned [i]smile[/i]!",

        "Aster: The blood I will spill will be the greatest [i]kindness[/i] this kingdom has ever known!",

        "Aster: I will [i]save[/i] my kingdom and its people![p/][s/] And I will carve the rot out of its heart, piece by bloody piece!",
        "Aster: Nothing will stand in my way!",
        "Aster: I am Aster de Wyverngarde![p/][s/] King of Wyverngarde,[p/][s/] and consort to the Lord of the Sixth!",
        "Aster: I am-!",

        "Tyrion: ...Its conditions have been fulfilled, haven't they?",

        "Lucio: Kingsguard![p/][s/] What are you standing around for?!",
        "Lucio: The Grand General has just committed regicide![p/][s/] Arrest him at once!",

        "Celeste: This doesn't really feel like something to celebrate...",
        "Rath: I'm compelled to agree.",

        "Aria: I am.[p/] There's no need to worry about me.",
        "Celeste: ...",

        "Aria: I was looking at the moon.[p/] It's full tonight.",
        "Celeste: ...Do you mind if I watch it with you?",
        "Aria: ...",
        "Aria: Do what you want.[p/] I technically take orders from you now.",
        "Celeste: ...You know.[p/] It was also a full moon outside on the night my parents found me in their inn.",
        "Celeste: That's why they named me \"Celeste\".[p/] It's the word for \"heavenly bodies\" in the draconic language.",
        "Aria: ...Is that so?",
        "Celeste: Yeah...[p/] They told me they thought I was a gift from the Scaled Lord.",
        "Celeste: In a roundabout way,[p/] they were actually kind of right.",
        "Celeste: It's a little funny when you think about it.",
        "Celeste: ...By the way,[p/] I never got to thank you for sticking up for me before.",
        "Aria: ...What?",
        "Celeste: Remember?[p/] You [i]jumped[/i] onto the stand when Tyrion manifested my Blood Contract.",
        "Celeste: Not that I blame him,[p/] but I don't think even [i]he[/i] believed in me at that point.",

        "Celeste: You're...[p/] not [i]really[/i] going to charge me with perjury, are you?",
        "Aria: Of course I am.[p/] I was serious about that.",
        "Celeste: Damn it...",
        "Aria: But we [i]do[/i] require your help to hold the structure of our kingdom together.",
        "Aria: We won't sentence you to prison,[p/] but I might have you do some community service.",

        "Celeste: H-[p/][s/]Hey...[p/][s/] You're not-!",
        "Aria: I am![p/][s/] I'm a complete and utter fool!",
        "Aria: I [i]knew[/i] about Blood Contracts after what happened to Beatrice!",
        "Aria: I'm an [i]attorney[/i], for Lord's sake!",
        "Aria:  I've read [i]countless[/i] legal documents!",
        "Aria: And when I signed that Contract,[p/] I [i]knew[/i] something was wrong!",

        "Celeste: That's not fair.",
        "Celeste: No [i]one[/i] could have expected him to do something like that.",
        "Aria: Now my father...[p/] h-[p/][s/]he's going to pay for my [i]stupid[/i] mistakes!",
        "Celeste: ...I'm sorry.",

        "Aria: He used me like a puppet...[p/] With [i]my[/i] hands and [i]my[/i] magic,[p/] he made me-[p/][s/]...",
        "Celeste: ...",
        "Celeste: I'm sorry, Aria.[p/] I...",
        "Celeste: What he did to you was horrible,[p/] and I don't know how to make it better.",

        "Celeste: It's not just me.",
        "Celeste: Tyrion,[p/] your father,[p/] we're all here for you.",

        "Aria: Celeste...[p/] I think I've made a decision.",
        "Celeste: What's that...?",
        "Aria: ...I'm going to drop the charges of perjury against you.",
        "Celeste: Wait...[p/] Are we still on that?",
        "Remus: Mr. Cuthbert,[p/] I've spoken with my associates in the press.",
        "Remus: The story we created should be printed as we speak.",
        "Celeste: ...I don't like this.",
        "Celeste: We're lying to the people of Wyverngarde about what [i]really[/i] happened.",
        "Celeste: Not to mention,[p/] this story paints me like I'm some kind of god.",
        "Tyrion: I understand your reservations,[p/] but Aster [i]was[/i] right about how the commonfolk felt about him.",
        "Tyrion: If we told the people what [i]actually[/i] happened-",
        "Aria: They would never believe it.",
        "Aria: They'd think that his death was a part of some sort of political conspiracy.",
        "Aria: And even [i]with[/i] this cover story,[p/] we can't be certain that they [i]still[/i] won't suspect that.",
        "Tyrion: A-[p/][s/]Aria?!",
        "Celeste: Shouldn't you be resting?!",
        "Aria: Nonsense,[p/] I'm not going to sit around feeling sorry for myself while everyone else fixes my mistakes.",
        "Tyrion: ...!",
        "She may be hiding her pain behind a smile,[p/] but she's not shutting down her emotions like before.",

        "Aria: As much as it pains me,[p/] we should strive to carry forth the virtues that His-...[p/] that [i]Aster[/i] represented to the commonfolk.",
        "Aria: Wyverngarde will gain more from those false virtues than from the person that he truly was.",
        "Aria: The stability of our nation must be maintained if we're to move forward,[p/] and if we must use the people's piety to do that,[p/] then so be it.",
        "Celeste: Aria...",
        "Aria: And as the newly appointed head of House Steelwind,[p/] I will also do my part to support your rule.",
        "Remus: As will the Scaled Lord.",
        "Celeste smiles in gratitude to their words,[p/] but she meekly glances at you expectantly.",
        "Tyrion: ...Do you even have to ask?",
        "Tyrion: I made a promise to you,[p/] didn't I?",
        "Celeste: Hehe...",

        "Celeste: W-[p/]Well,[p/] she wasn't her usual self.[p/] It's like she was in some kind of daze.",
        "Celeste: I...[p/] noticed it even before she attacked me.[p/] Something was wrong with her.",
        "Celeste: Oh, yeah...[p/] And she didn't even respond to me when I tried to talk to her.",
        "Celeste: It's like she didn't even recognize me.",
        "Tyrion: But from what Lord Asclepius said,[p/] she would've been acting more erratically if she was affected by Mageblight.",
        "Tyrion: It's possible that you fought someone disguised as her.",
        "Celeste: ...I guess that's possible.",
        "Celeste: But [i]whoever[/i] they were,[p/] their magic was still extremely powerful.",
        "Tyrion: ...And several members of the four Pillar Families were assembled here.",
        "Tyrion: It could have been one of them.",
        "Tyrion: We should speak with Commander White when we get the chance.",
        "Tyrion: The Grand Cathedral was closed from the public for...[p/] [i]whatever[/i] was happening here.",
        "Tyrion: They probably have a list of everyone who was present when the murders happened.",

        "Celeste: No.[p/] But it got pretty close.",
        "Celeste: ...I think she realized that she couldn't beat me.[p/] So she just ran past me and into the Prayer Room.",

        "Tyrion: Did you see the moment she murdered Pierce?",
        "Celeste: N-[p/]No...[p/] When I arrived at the Prayer Room,[p/] I saw you and Steelwind unconscious on the ground.",

        "Celeste: Right...",

        "Tyrion: How long did you fight Steelwind before she pushed past you?",

        "As you approach the Grand Cathedral,[p/] you see a large blockade guarded by legions of the Kingsguard.",
        "Celeste: It's closed off...[p/] Is there some kind of event going on?",
        "You recall Steelwind mentioning that she was heading here as well.",
        "The nobility must be using the cathedral grounds for something.",
        "It might explain why Pierce wanted to meet you here.[p/] It's probably secluded from prying eyes today.",
        "Knight: ...Tyrion Cuthbert?",
        "As you approach the blockade,[p/] one of the knights notices you.",
        "He glances at you and Celeste.",
        "Knight: ...We've been expecting you.",
        "Tyrion: I...[p/] see.",
        "You exchange glances with Celeste.[p/] But you both enter the cathedral grounds.",
        "The main building is massive...[p/] yet mostly empty.",
        "You only see a few people within,[p/] and most of them are quite familiar.",
        "You spot Laefe and Miriam as you head further into the room.",
        "They both avoid eye contact with you.[p/] But it doesn't seem to be [i]purely[/i] out of resentment.",
        "As soon as they see you,[p/] they move their conversation elsewhere.",
        "It's clear they still have mixed feelings about how you convicted their sister.",
        "In another corner of the room,[p/] you spot Lloyd von Sanctus speaking with another individual.",
        "She seems to be someone of equal social standing.",
        "You feel like you've seen her somewhere before.[p/] But you can't quite remember where.",
        "As soon as you enter the room,[p/] von Sanctus flashes a quick look of disdain at you.",
        "You see him slowly move his conversation out of the room as well.",
        "And finally,[p/] you see Lucio Steelwind speaking with his daughter.",
        "...along with the two princes.",
        "They seem to speaking with another individual that you haven't met before.",
        "When he notices you,[p/] his gaze narrows.[p/] And he stares at the two of you warily.",
        "Aster, especially, seems surprised to see you here.",
        "He and Lucio ask the prosecutor something.[p/] But you can't quite hear their conversation.",
        "When she responds,[p/] Aster raises his eyebrows and Lucio's expression darkens.",
        "What's going on here?",
        "Celeste: This is a little awkward.",
        "Tyrion: Yeah...",
        "Tyrion: But we have some time before our meeting with Pierce.",
        "Tyrion: ...You want to do some sightseeing?",
        "Celeste: Oh?[p/] Are you asking me out?",
        "Tyrion: We are [i]literally[/i] already out.",
        "Celeste: Sure.[p/] Why not?",
        "Celeste: I picked up this map from the entrance.[p/] We can use it to navigate through the area.",
        "{0}",
        "Celeste: I'm also a little interested in what all these nobles are doing here.",
        "It [i]is[/i] strange.[p/] Perhaps someone can tell you more."
